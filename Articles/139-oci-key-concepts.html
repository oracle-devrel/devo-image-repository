        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 1. Root Tenancy</p>



        <h2>Tenancies and Compartments</h2>

        <p>When you <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/">sign up</a> for an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
            account, you&rsquo;re assigned a secure and isolated partition within the cloud infrastructure called a
            <strong>tenancy</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>The tenancy has the same name as the cloud account that you selected during the sign-up process. If you
            want to change the tenancy name, you can do so by following these <a
                href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/renamecloudaccount.htm">instructions</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The tenancy is a logical concept. You can think of it as a root container where you can create, organize,
            and administer your cloud resources.</p>

        <p>The second logical concept used for organizing and controlling access to cloud resources is
            <strong>compartments</strong>. A compartment is a collection of related cloud resources. Your tenancy is
            also your root compartment.
        </p>

        <p>You can create more compartments within your tenancy (up to six-levels deep) and use corresponding
            policies to control access to the resources in each compartment. Every time you create a cloud resource,
            you must specify the compartment that you want the resource to belong to.</p>

        <p>The following figure shows a compartment called Engineering inside the root compartment. The Engineering
            compartment has two sub-compartments (for Project-A and Project-B), and each one of those compartments
            is further separated into multiple compartments.</p>

        <p>This structure isolates resources between environments (development, QA, production) and different
            projects. You can apply policies to and designate administrators for each compartment. Creating more
            fine-grained policies ensures that users have access to the compartments that they need and that
            resources can connect to each other.</p>


        <h2>Create compartments</h2>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s create a compartment structure like the one in the previous figure.</p>

        <p>1. <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html">Sign in to your OCI account</a>.</p>

        <p>2. Open the navigation menu, select Identity, and then select Compartments.</p>

        <p>3. To create a sub-compartment in your tenancy, click Create Compartment.</p>

        <p>4. In the Create Compartment dialog, enter the name of the first compartment (in our example, Engineering)
            and a description, and then select the tenancy or root compartment from the Parent Compartment menu. Click
            Create Compartment.</p>

        <!--<div class="cc01w2"><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/cc01-create-compartments.jpg" /></div>-->
        <p>When it&rsquo;s created, the compartment is assigned an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID), like any other
            resource in OCI. You can read more about OCID and other resource identifiers in the documentation.</p>

        <p>The OCID uses the following syntax:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
	ocid1...[REGION][.FUTURE USE].
	
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The following example, shows what the OCID of your compartment might look like:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>

ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaaexampleuniqueID 


</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>You can follow the same steps to create sub-compartments for Project A and Project B inside the Engineering
            compartment and the Dev, QA, and Prod compartments inside each project.</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s what the Project-A compartment details page looks like after its subcompartments are created:

        <h2>Policy inheritance and attachment</h2>

        <p>With the compartment hierarchy set up as described, the sub-compartments inherit all access permissions from
            the compartments higher up in the hierarchy. For example, the Prod compartment inherits the permissions from
            Project-A and Project-A inherits the permissions from the Engineering compartment.</p>

        <p>When you create an access policy, you need to specify which compartment to attach it to. This setting
            controls who can later modify or delete the policy. For example, you could create an access policy for the
            Project-A compartment and attach it to the same compartment. With this design, you can give the
            administrators of the Project-A compartment access to manage their own compartment&rsquo;s policies.
            However, if you attach that same access policy to the Engineering compartment, only people who have access
            to manage policies in the Engineering compartment can modify or delete the policy.</p>

        <h2>Moving resources between compartments</h2>


        <p>Most of the resources created in a compartment can be moved to another compartment. However, some resources
            can’t be moved, such as Container Engine for Kubernetes clusters, functions, or policies.</p>

        <p>Additionally, some resources might have attached resource dependencies. When you move such resources, the
            attached dependencies move asynchronously. So, even if the parent resource is moved and immediately visible
            in the new compartment, it might take time for the attached dependencies to move and become visible in the
            new compartment.</p>

        <p>For some resources, the attached resource dependencies don’t automatically move to the new compartment. You
            must move these resources independently.</p>

        <p>Finally, be aware of how the policies work when moving resources between compartments. When you move a
            resource to a new compartment, the policies that govern the new compartment are immediately applied and will
            affect access to the resource.</p>

        <p>To learn more about compartments, see the Managing compartments documentation.</p>

        <h2>Regions and Realms</h2>


        <p>Now that you understand what tenancies and compartments are and how they work, let&rsquo;s look at regions
            and realms. When you signed up for your account, you selected your home region, and a tenancy was created
            for you in that region. Your home region is the geographic location where your account and Identity Access
            Management (IAM) resources are created.</p>

        <p>You can create and update the following resources only in the home region:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Users</li>
            <li>Groups</li>
            <li>Policies</li>
            <li>Compartments</li>
            <li>Dynamic groups</li>
            <li>Federation resources</li>
        </ul>


        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 2. Multiple Regions "
                src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/cc01-multiple-regions.jpg" /></p>
        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2. Multiple Regions </p>



        <p>You can&rsquo;t change your home region. However, through the Console or the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
            CLI, you can subscribe your tenancy to other regions.</p>

        <p>When you subscribe to a region, the IAM resources in your home region are propagated and enforced in that
            region. Using policies you can define access levels for each region separately.</p>

        <p>If we take the compartment hierarchy from the previous example and subscribe to two more regions, we can
            then create individual resources in those regions as shown in the following figure. Notice that the
            compartments span the regions, but the resources within those compartments are created in specific
            regions.</p>

        <p>For more information more about supported regions, see the Data Regions page.</p>

        <p>All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources are physically hosted in regions and in one or more
            availability domains. An availability domain is a data center located in a region. Availability domains
            (AD) are isolated from each other - they don&rsquo;t share infrastructure, such as power or networking.
            This isolation minimizes the possibility of simultaneous failures. By using multiple availability
            domains, you can create a highly-available and resilient architecture.</p>

        <p>A realm is a logical collection of regions. Realms are isolated from each other, and they don&rsquo;t
            share any data. A tenancy can exist in a single realm, and it has access to the regions that belong to
            that realm. Currently, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has a single commercial realm (OC1) and multiple
            realms for the Government Cloud.</p>


        <h3>Additional OCI Resources</h3>

        <p>This blog post gave you a short overview of some of the key concepts and terminology you need to
            understand when working with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We briefly mentioned access policies, and
            we&rsquo;ll explain those in more detail in the next post.</p>
