        <p>If you are a typical software developer, all the machine learning buzz might seem confusing to you,
            especially when it comes to heavy math and statistics stuff that you haven&rsquo;t been using for years or
            maybe never really understood.</p>

        <p>This article aims to explain machine learning so you can have a better idea how you can use it and benefit
            from it. To achieve this, we&rsquo;re going to reuse your existing Java knowledge and extend it with new
            machine learning concepts. After we cover the basics by exploring a Java code example for spam email
            classification using neural networks, everything else about how machine learning works should make more
            sense to you.</p>

        <p>The example explored in this article uses <a
                href="https://github.com/deepnetts/deepnetts-communityedition">Deep Netts</a>, a Java-based deep
            learning development platform that provides a pure Java, open source, community edition of the <a
                href="http://deepnetts.com/">Deep Netts deep learning engine</a>. This engine is a reference
            implementation for the Visual Recognition (VisRec) API developed within the JCP as JSR 381, and it is a part
            of the efforts for standardizing APIs and evolving machine learning support for the Java platform.</p>

        <p>One of the main ideas behind Deep Netts is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use API that will enable Java
            developers to apply machine learning using their existing Java knowledge; simplify integration, deployment,
            and maintenance of machine learning solutions; and improve the overall developer experience.</p>

        <h3>What Is Machine Learning?</h3>

        <p>Machine learning is a type of computer algorithm that is able to adjust a set of its own internal parameters
            using sample data in order to perform a specific task on similar data.</p>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s take a more detailed look at this. Machine learning is an algorithm, pretty much like a sorting
            algorithm, which performs various operations with in-memory data structures. Usually this algorithm has a
            number of parameters that determine its operation. What makes it special is that it is able to adjust its
            own parameters using sample data, and this process is referred to as <em>learning or training</em>.</p>

        <p>You can think of machine learning as a kind of self-configurable algorithm. A machine learning algorithm
            trained for specific data or a specific problem is called a <em>model</em>. Sample data used to train the
            model is called the <em>training</em> set.</p>

        <p>Once a model is done with training, it can perform some specific task, for example, assign a category label
            to some input (classification) or estimate some quantity (regression). Both of these tasks are sometimes
            referred to as prediction. It&rsquo;s also important to note that it&rsquo;s expected that models will make
            mistakes (errors) in these predictions, and that these tasks will be performed with a certain degree of
            accuracy.</p>

        <p>As long as appropriate data about the problem is available, machine learning can be useful for solving tasks
            that are difficult or impossible to solve directly using a fixed set of rules or formulas.</p>

        <h3>Example Use Case: Spam Classification</h3>

        <p>Email spam classification is a simple example of a problem suitable for machine learning. The task is to
            determine whether some email is spam or is not spam. As you probably know from personal experience, there
            are cases when this can’t be easily decided only by keywords in the subject or message, and additional
            properties of email message need to be taken into account. One way to solve this is to gather a set of
            example emails for spam and non-spam, and train a machine learning model. </p>

        <p>There is a publicly available data set that we&rsquo;ll use, which contains <strong>4,000 emails</strong>
            labeled in Figure 1 as spam (1) or non-spam (0). The data set is available as a CSV file, which is a
            commonly used format for machine learning data sets. For every email, there are 48 features that correspond
            to the frequency of occurrence of specific words; 6 features that correspond to the occurrence of specific
            characters, 3 features that correspond to the occurrence of capital letters; and the last feature, which
            corresponds to the spam/non-spam label. This type of task, in which you have to assign items to one of two
            categories, is called <strong>binary classification</strong>. Figure 1 shows a few sample lines from the CSV
            file.</p>

        <center><strong>Figure 1</strong>. Sample rows from the spam data set with info about the occurrence of words,
            characters, and capital letters Sample rows from the spam data set with info about the occurrence of words,
            characters, and capital letters</center>

        <p>In order to build a binary classifier for the given CSV file, we need to perform following steps:</p>

        <p>1. Read data from the CSV file and create an in-memory data set.<br />
            2. Configure and create a neural network for binary classification tasks.<br />
            3. Train the neural network using the loaded data set.<br />
            4. Test the trained model to see how well it is performing.</p>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s get to the code. Listing 1 is a Java code snippet for creating a binary classifier using a
            feed-forward neural network for a given CSV file in just few lines of code. It is using the community
            edition of <a href="https://github.com/deepnetts/deepnetts-communityedition">Deep Netts</a>. Table 1 is an
            overview of the classes and methods used in Listing 1. Listing 1.</p>

        <p>The <strong>feed-forward neural network</strong> used in this example is a machine learning algorithm that is
            represented as a graph-like structure in Figure 2. Each node in this graph performs some calculation, which
            transforms its input. Each node applies some function to all of the inputs it receives from other nodes, and
            each node sends its result to the other nodes it is connected to. Nodes in this graph are organized into
            groups called layers. All nodes receive inputs from nodes in the previous layer and send output to nodes in
            the next layer. This results in a forward signal flow, and that&rsquo;s where the name comes from.</p>

        <p>There is very rough analogy between the kind of interaction shown in the computational graph and the way the
            neuron cells in a brain interact, and that&rsquo;s why these graphs are also referred to as a <strong>neural
                network</strong>. Each connection between two nodes has an internal parameter called connection weight,
            and by adjusting these parameters during the training procedure, these graphs are configured to perform some
            desired behavior. The network learns by adjusting these parameters using a mathematical procedure to make
            the difference between the target outputs specified in a data set and the outputs of the network as small as
            possible. The difference between the target and network outputs is calculated using a so-called <em>error
                function</em> (aka a loss function).</p>

        <center><img alt="" src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/devo-java-nn-figure-2.jpg" /></center>

        <center><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Feed-forward neural network depicted as a directed graph</center>

        <p>A feed-forward neural network must have only one input layer, only one output layer, and one or more hidden
            layers.</p>

        <p>The input layer accepts external input (in this example, an email feature array), and the output layer
            provides the end result, which in our spam example is the probability that email is spam.</p>

        <p>The number of nodes in the input layer corresponds to the number of input features in the data set, and the
            number of nodes in the output layer corresponds to the number of outputs in the data set. The size of the
            layers and the number of hidden layers are configurable parameters, and the optimal values depend on the
            problem and the data. In its simplest form, these parameters are determined experimentally, but there are
            also advanced algorithms to automatically search for optimal values for these parameters. In this type of
            neural network, hidden layers are so-called fully connected layers, which means that each node in a layer is
            connected to all the nodes in the previous layer.</p>

        <p>In Listing 1, the feed-forward network has been configured to work as a binary classifier by setting
            functions that are commonly used for this type of task: <code class="ocode">ActivationType.RELU</code> for
            the hidden layer, <code class="ocode">ActivationType .SIGMOID</code> for the output layer, and <code
                class="ocode">LossType.CROSS_ENTROPY</code> for the error function.</p>

        <p>Listing 1 can be used as a template for other binary classification data sets. You just need to change the
            number of nodes in the input and output layers and tweak the hidden layers, as shown in Table 2. A
            feed-forward network can also be used for other types of machine learning tasks by setting the appropriate
            error and activation functions.</p>

        <h3>How to Prepare the Data for Neural Network Training</h3>

        <p>In most cases, data from a CSV file needs to be prepared so it can be used for neural network training. In
            order for a neural network to be able to use data, the data needs to be transformed into numeric values (0
            and 1) in a range. The data transformation operation that scales data to some range is called
            <em>normalization</em>. In the Deep Netts API, this operation is provided by the <code
                class="ocode">MaxNormalizer</code> class.</p>

        <p>The trained machine learning model will be used in production with some new (hopefully similar) data that has
            not been used for training. To estimate the classification accuracy on unseen data, the available data set
            is randomly split into a training set and a test set, which are then used for training and testing
            respectively. The ratio between the training and test set split is usually 60% for training and 40% for
            testing or 70% for training and 30% for testing, depending of the amount of available data. Example code for
            loading, preprocessing, and splitting data into training and test set is shown in Listing 2.</p>

        <h3>How to Train a Neural Network</h3>

        <p>After you have prepared the data and created the neural network, the next step is to train the neural
            network. A feed-forward neural network is trained using a <em>backpropagation algorithm</em>, which is a
            commonly used algorithm for various types of problems and neural networks. The Deep Netts API provides an
            implementation of this algorithm in the <a
                href="https://www.deepnetts.com/apidocs/deepnetts/net/train/BackpropagationTrainer.html">BackpropagationTrainer
                class.</a> The method <code class="ocode">NeuralNetwork.getTrainer()</code> returns an instance of the
            trainer that will be used to train the parent network. After setting a few parameters that control the
            algorithm&rsquo;s behavior, the train method is invoked on a neural network using the training set as a
            method parameter, which starts the training procedure. This process is shown in Listing 3. Table 3 shows the
            backpropagation trainer configuration parameters, and Output 1 shows the total data set error and accuracy
            over training iterations (epochs).</p>

        <h3>How to Test a Classifier</h3>

        <p>In order to make sure that the trained classifier will provide an acceptable level of accuracy while
            classifying new emails, we&rsquo;re going to perform a test procedure (aka an <strong>evaluation
                procedure</strong>). A test procedure for a classifier performs classification on test data that has not
            been used for training the classifier. It counts the correct and wrong classifications, and it calculates
            various additional metrics that help you understand various properties of the classifier. The Deep Netts API
            provides an easy way to perform a test procedure using just one call to a utility method from the Evaluators
            class (shown in Listing 4), which returns an object that contains a map of classification-specific metrics.
            Output 2 shows the most-important evaluation results that explain various classifier performance metrics.

        <h3>How to Use a Trained Classifier</h3>

        <p>Now that we have a trained classifier, we can use it to classify some new emails. Listing 5 shows example
            code:</p>

        <p><strong>Listing 5.</strong> Using the trained spam classifier</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
        // create binary classifier using trained network
        BinaryClassifier binClassifier = 
                                                new FeedForwardNetBinaryClassifier(neuralNet);        
        // get test email as an array of features
        float[] testEmail = testSet.get(0).getInput().getValues();

        // get probability score that email is spam
        Float result = binClassifier.classify(testEmail);
        System.out.println(&quot;Spam probability: &quot;+result);  

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The trained network is wrapped with the <code class="ocode">FeedForwardNetBinaryClassifier class</code>,
            which makes it intuitive what the network does, how to use it, and what the inputs and outputs are. The
            <code class="ocode">BinaryClassifier</code> interface from the Visual Recognition API uses generics to
            specify the type of inputs for a specific binary classifier, which in this case is an array of email
            features. Note that this can be relatively easily changed to some user-defined class.</p>

        <p>An email to classify is provided from test set as an array of email features (the same set of features that
            we used to train the classifier). This array is then used as input for the <code
                class="ocode">classify</code> method of the classifier.</p>

        <p>The classification result for the binary classifier is given as a probability score, which indicates how
            likely it is that the given email is spam.</p>

        <h3>Code for the Complete Example</h3>

        <p>The full Java code for this spam classifier example, which includes loading, data preprocessing, training,
            and testing, is available as a Maven project on <a
                href="https://github.com/deepnetts/SpamClassifier">GitHub</a>. Listing 6 shows the full workflow.</p>
