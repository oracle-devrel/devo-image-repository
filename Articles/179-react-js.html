        <p>There are more than 200 programming languages developers use all over the world. JavaScript has been
            among
            the most popular for more than 20 years because of its ease of use and extensive frameworks and
            libraries
            available. </p>

        <p>JavaScript frameworks and libraries make applications and website development easier, making interactive
            web
            pages quicker and more efficient. Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code someone else wrote,
            and
            you are adapting for your own use.</p>

        <p>The technical difference between the two developer tools is that with a library, you choose where and
            when
            you want to plug in the code. With a framework, you have limited choices. You plug in your code wherever
            it
            allows you to.</p>

        <h2>React.js definition</h2>

        <p>Before explaining what React Javascript is, it's important to understand the definition of JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows the implementation of complex features in web design.
            JavaScript is a growing and evolving language that has innumerable uses.</p>

        <p>If a web page does anything other than display static information and require a UI (User Interface) or
            includes animated graphics or photo slideshows, you can be guaranteed JavaScript is probably part of the
            coding.</p>

        <p>To use JavaScript, you will need some basic understanding of HTML and CSS. HTML structures the web
            content
            with headers, paragraphs, tables, and images. CSS controls color, font, and animation.</p>

        <p>Should you need UI or other animation, JavaScript will be part of these layered web technologies.
            JavaScript
            has a wealth of libraries that contain functions or lines of code for performing specific tasks on a web
            page that requires input from a user.</p>

        <p>React is a front-end UI JavaScript library that requires input from a user, which will drive other
            processes
            smoothly. Using React Js, developers need less time to develop an interactive web page and has much
            fewer
            opportunities for errors and bugs.</p>

        <h2>Why Use React?</h2>

        <p>Facebook <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-react-js/">created React in 2011</a> but is now
            widely
            used by other companies. In fact, it has eclipsed all other front-end development libraries.</p>

        <p>Using React, it is much easier to create dynamic web applications because you require much less coding.
            The
            Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) updates only components that need updating.</p>

        <p>Data flows in one direction only, allowing web developers to nest secondary components (or child
            components)
            within primary ones (or parent components). Errors are thereby easier to debug and code is more stable.
        </p>

        <p>If you know how to use HTML and JavaScript, the learning curve for beginners is much smaller. You can
            also
            use React to develop web and mobile apps. The mobile apps are developed using React Native, a spinoff
            from
            ReactJs, which Facebook developed in 2015.</p>

        <p>Facebook recently released a Chrome extension that allows easy debugging of React applications.<br />
            These are only a few of the reasons why so many developers choose to do front-end web development with
            React.</p>

        <h2>Features of React JavaScript</h2>

        <p>The powerful features described in this section have made React a robust contender in the JavaScript
            universe. It performs quickly and efficiently and allows developers more flexibility with its use of
            third-party libraries. </p>

    <div class="rc24w1 cwidth">
        <h2>React Components</h2>

        <p>React is centered around the development of components that you can reuse over and over again. A
            component is
            like a function or building block of an application. All apps consist of multiple components.</p>

        <p>React splits a UI into reusable, independent parts that can be processed separately. Components can be
            built
            within other components, the parent component being the initiator and the child component receiving the
            information from the parent.
        </p>



        <h4>JSX</h4>
        <p>All basic web pages are created as HTML documents. A web browser reads these documents and displays them
            on
            the screen of your device. This is done by creating a Document Object Model (DOM) or tree of how this
            web
            page is arranged.</p>

        <p>Dynamic content is added to this web page by including modifications using a language like JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>JSX (JavaScript eXtension) is a feature of React that facilitates the modification of a DOM using HTML
            code.
            It is also compatible with all web browsers.</p>


        <h4>Virtual DOM</h4>
        <p>One of the powerful features of React is the Virtual DOM. As mentioned before, your web page uses HTML to
            update its DOM whenever a user interacts with the page.</p>

        <p>Under normal circumstances, this requires the reloading of the entire DOM with every interaction. This
            takes
            time and computing power.</p>

        <p>React's Virtual DOM, using JSX, will create a copy of the page's DOM, and React JS uses this copy to
            determine what parts of the actual DOM need to change. This way, the entire web page does not need to
            reload, just the relevant section or sections.
        <p>

        <h4>States and Hooks</h4>
        <p>Using React JS, you create interactive experiences for users by deciding which components will be static
            and
            mutable. This is called a React state. For a data component to be considered a state, it has to change
            over
            time and can't remain permanently static.</p>

        <p>Every time a state changes, the component will re-render. State changes happen based on user action or
            system-generated events.</p>

        <p>React hooks are features that connect the internal logic between components. It will intercept function
            calls
            or messages passing between components based on a set of logic commands. It can also halt rewriting a
            component or allow a modification of a component.
        <p>

        <h4>Props</h4>
        <p>The term 'props' is short-form for properties. It's a built-in object in React which stores a tag's
            attribute
            (similar to HTML attributes). It's a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in
            the
            same way HTML passes attributes in a function.</p>

        <p>Props get unwieldy when the parent component passes a tag through several child components to a final
            destination component. You can manage this more efficiently using a spread operator.</p>
        <p>A spread operator will expand iterables such as strings and arrays into individual elements. This
            facilitates
            the movement of props between components.</p>

        <h4>Debugging</h4>
        <p>Bugs and errors are generally avoided in React because of the component feature. They will still appear,
            but
            by the very nature of the structure of this JavaScript library, they are quite easy to detect. The large
            developer community also makes detection very easy.</p>

        <p>Facebook also created a nifty browser extension for Chrome that adds a React tab in the developer tools
            option. This tab makes inspection of React components quick and easy.</p>

        <p>Both of these developer tools use JavaScript differently and have different uses and advantages. Both
            React
            and Angular are component-based as well. One of the key points is that React is a JavaScript library,

            file to advise how to build/compile the project.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the main repository has a “Releases” tab which takes you to a list of releases where the
