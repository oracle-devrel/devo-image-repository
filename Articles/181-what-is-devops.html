        <p>What is DevOps? Simply put, DevOps is a combination of two functions that are typically treated separately:
            development and operations. That definition of DevOps is the what. The why is even easier. Standardized
            development methodology, clear communication, and documented processes supported by a standards-based,
            proven middleware platform improve application development and management cycles, bring agility, and provide
            greater availability and security to your IT infrastructure. Clearly, DevOps is about connecting people,
            products, and processes. Ultimately, DevOps is about connecting IT to business.</p>

        <h2 class="rw-ptitle">DevOps—Where development meets operations</h2>
        <h4>Development:</h4>
        <p>The infrastructure necessary to bring together development, from sharing assets to writing code and
            algorithms for enterprise applications that may leverage advanced capabilities such as artificial
            intelligence/machine learning, containers, and serverless functions. In addition, testing, archiving,
            bug-tracking, and other critical tasks are handled in the development phase, all on the road to launch. Some
            common tools used for development: Git for checking-in code, Github or evolving Bitbucket for managing code
            repositories.</p>
        <h4>Operations:</h4>
        <p>Once an application is deployed, the operations side takes over with a focus on ensuring the business
            challenges of cloud platforms are met. Issues such as user security, database management, scalability for
            production workloads, and application patching are all handled in this function. Some common tools used for
            operations: Terraform, Ansible, Puppet and Chef for managing infrastructure and configurations.</p>
        <p>In many organizations, those two functions exist in different silos. DevOps brings development and operations
            together to create a unified infrastructure that maximizes productivity. In order to support both sides of
            the equation, the infrastructure must be agile, flexible, and scalable, with inputs and integrations
            regarding security and quality assurance shared between developers and operators/systems administrators.</p>
        <p>The result is an efficient model that maximizes resources while working with the increasingly fast pace of
            the software development life cycle, something that has become harder and harder to support under the
            traditional software development model. Ultimately, a strong DevOps model enables businesses to fix
            problems, scale user growth, and better serve customers with a path to developing and iterating on software
            products faster.</p>

        <h2 class="rw-ptitle">How DevOps can accelerate your product development?</h2>
        <p>In the past twenty years, business has gradually shifted to integrate software into nearly every element
            —finance, entertainment, consumer usage, supply chain, and everything else. With each of these functions,
            clear integration of software and data have emerged, and as that integration becomes more prevalent, the
            stakes in performance and reliability become higher. A single bug or outage in availability could affect
            countless users, and possible interrupt millions in revenue.</p>
        <p>DevOps and DevSecOps provide a means to address the need of the software development life cycle (SDLC) to
            provide continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Integrating development, operations, and
            security delivers practical benefits to resources while also enabling faster communication and collaboration
            across the lifecycle. The ability to build a bridge between these groups—all while shortening the overall
            software development life cycle—gives DevOps meaning and value, regardless of industry.</p>

        <h2 class="rw-ptitle">Benefits of DevOps</h2>
        <p>Adopting DevOps to support the entire software development life cycle&mdash;with an emphasis on agility and
            efficiency regardless of function provides a number of benefits:</p>
        <ul class="obullets">
            <li><strong>Enabling speed:</strong> With an agile DevOps model, technology is optimized to the current
                needs of the life cycle. In many cases, DevOps uses cutting-edge machine learning and artificial
                intelligence to expedite this. In fact, a recently coined term, AIOps, refers to the use of artificial
                intelligence in IT operations. DevOps also emphasizes automation and continuous integration/delivery,
                alleviating staff from manual tasks to focus on innovation. On the development side, engineers can hit
                their code milestones faster or collaborate more effectively. On the operations side, systems
                administrators can leverage automation frameworks to easily provision and update new applications and
                infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> By enabling speed, DevOps opens up new paths to greater quality and
                reliability. This starts on the development side, with faster collaboration and better tools for problem
                solving and integration. On the operations side, smaller and more frequent updates allow for greater
                stability, which increases the overall quality of experience for the userbase.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Using DevOps provides several different layers to enhancing your overall
                security. From a functional perspective, DevOps sometimes includes the integration of security teams.
                This creates a model sometimes referred to as DevSecOps, which equally balances security next to
                development and operational needs. On a more granular level, the speed of DevSecOps allows for quick
                patching, audits and analysis powered by artificial intelligence, automated compliance, and automated
                resource management.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Agile resources, automation, and the ability to support the complete
                software development life cycle means that infrastructure is poised to support scaling as needed.
                Because scaling touches many different elements, supporting a holistic view of technology helps to
                efficiently scale while handling everything from resource management to patch rollout.</li>

        <h2 class="rw-ptitle">What is CI/CD? Continuous integration and continuous delivery</h2>
        <p>Rapid delivery of software is essential for running your applications in the cloud efficiently. Continuous
            Integration (CI) refers to frequently merging new software using a single line of code. Continuous delivery
            refers to the production of packaged software out of code in frequent cycles. Likewise, Continuous
            deployment refers to the deployment of the packaged software to a runtime platform in periodic cycles. The
            advent of CI/CD has revamped the traditional application development process drastically. The CI/CD-based
            process involves DevOps—the paradigm shift that brings developers, QA engineers, and operations managers
            together on one platform.</p>
        <p>But can the CI/CD-based application development process be improved even further? The most modern approach is
            to use <a href="/cloud-native/container-registry/what-is-docker/">containerization</a> to bring even more
            flexibility and benefits.</p>
        <h4>Continuous Integration (CI):</h4>
        <p>The most critical step for continuous delivery of software is continuous integration (CI). CI is a
            development practice where developers commit their code changes (usually small and incremental) to a
            centralized source repository, which kicks off a set of automated builds and tests. This repository allows
            developers to capture the bugs early and automatically before passing them on to production. Continuous
            Integration pipeline usually involves a series of steps, starting from code commit to performing basic
            automated linting/static analysis, capturing dependencies, and finally building the software and performing
            some basic unit tests before creating a build artifact. Source code management systems like Github, Gitlab,
            etc., offer webhooks integration to which CI tools like Jenkins can subscribe to start running automated
            builds and tests after each code check-in.</p>
        <h4>Continuous Delivery (CD):</h4>
        <p>Continuous delivery picks up where our continuous integration story ends. CD automates the delivery of
            applications to cloud infrastructure environments. Most teams work with multiple development and testing
            environments other than the primary production server. Continuous delivery will ensure an automated way to
            push the new and tested code changes across all cloud environments.</p>
