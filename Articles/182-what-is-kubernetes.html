                <p>Often described as the “operating system for the cloud,” Kubernetes is an open source
                        platform for managing clusters of containerized applications and services. Developed by
                        Google engineers Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie in 2014 and open sourced
                        shortly thereafter, Kubernetes soon became a thriving, cloud native ecosystem in its own
                        right. Today, Kubernetes—which means “helmsman” or “pilot” in ancient
                        Greek—is managed by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank">Cloud
                                Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>, an arm of the Linux Foundation.</p>
                <p>Kubernetes was the first graduated project for the CNCF, and it became one of the fastest
                        growing open source projects in history. Kubernetes now has more than 2,300
                        contributors, and has been widely adopted by companies large and small, including half
                        of the Fortune 100.</p>

                <p>To begin with, here are a few key terms related to Kubernetes. There is a more exhaustive
                        list
                        available on the Kubernetes Standardized Glossary page. You can also leverage the <a
                                href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/"
                                target="_blank">Kubernetes Cheat Sheet</a>, which contains a list of commonly
                        used
                        kubectl commands and flags.</p>
                <h4>Cluster</h4>
                <p> Is a set of machines individually referred to as nodes used to run containerized
                        applications
                        managed by Kubernetes.</p>
                <h4>Node</h4>
                <p>Is either a virtual or physical machine. A cluster consists of a master node and a number of
                        worker
                        nodes.</p>
                <h4>Cloud Container</h4>
                <p>Is an image that contains software and its dependencies.</p>
                <h4>Pod</h4>
                <p>Is a single container or a set of containers running on your Kubernetes cluster.</p>
                <h4>Deployment</h4>
                <p>Is an object that manages replicated applications represented by pods. Pods are deployed onto
                        the
                        nodes of a cluster.</p>
                <h4>Replicaset</h4>
                <p>Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at one time.</p>
                <h4>Service</h4>
                <p>Describes how to access applications represented by a set of pods. Services typically
                        describe ports
                        and load balancers, and can be used to control internal and external access to a
                        cluster.</p>

                        with 500 attendees, KubeCon has grown to become an important event for the cloud native
                        community. In 2019, the San Diego, California edition of KubeCon drew 12,000 developers
                        and site
                        reliability engineers who were celebrating the open source ecosystem blossoming around

                        Containers?</h2>
                <p>As developers increasingly deploy software for a diverse set of computing environments with
                        different
                        clouds, test environments, laptops, devices, operating systems, and platforms, the issue
                        of
                        making the software run reliably is of paramount importance. That’s where containers
                        come in:
                        They bundle an application with its entire runtime environment. In this sense,
                        containers are a
                        form of virtualization because they provide a “bubble” in which the application can run
                        by
                        including the correct libraries, dependencies, and operating systems. But containers are
                        smaller
                        than virtual machines because they contain only the resources the application needs, and
                        nothing
                        more.</p>

                <p>While Linux containers have existed since 2008, it took the emergence of Docker containers in
                        2013 to
                        make them famous. Similarly, the explosion of interest in deploying containerized
                        applications—applications that contained everything they needed to run—ultimately
                        created a new
                        problem: managing thousands of containers. Kubernetes automatically orchestrates the
                        container
                        lifecycle, distributing the containers across the hosting infrastructure. Kubernetes
                        scales
                        resources up or down, depending on demand. It provisions, schedules, deletes, and
                        monitors the
                        health of the containers.</p>

                <p>The key components of Kubernetes are clusters, nodes, and the control plane. Clusters contain
                        nodes.
                        Each node comprises a set of at least one worker machine. The nodes host pods that
                        contain
                        elements of the deployed application. The control plane manages nodes and pods in the
                        cluster,
                        often across many computers, for high availability.</p>

                        challenges of using Kubernetes?</h2>
                <p>While Kubernetes is highly composable and can support any type of application, it can be
                        difficult to
                        understand and use. Kubernetes is not always the correct solution for a given workload,
                        as a
                        number of CNCF members have commented on. Which is why the Kubernetes ecosystem contains
                        a
                        number of related cloud native tools that organizations have created to solve specific
                        workload
                        issues.</p>
                <p>Kubernetes deploys containers, not source code, and does not build applications. For logging,
                        middleware, monitoring, configuration, CI/CD, and many other production activities,
                        you’ll need
                        additional tools. That said, Kubernetes is extensible, and has proven to be adept for a
                        wide
                        variety of use cases from jet planes to machine learning. In fact, cloud vendors
                        including
                        Oracle, Google, Amazon Web Services, and others have used Kubernetes’ own extensibility
                        to build
                        managed Kubernetes, which are services that reduce complexity and increase developer
                        productivity.</p>
