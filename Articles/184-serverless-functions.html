        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Serverless functions are part of an evolution in cloud computing that has helped free organizations from many
            of the constraints of managing infrastructure and resources. They enable developers to focus on writing code
            for event-driven applications that respond to a variety of triggers without worrying about the underlying
            platform management.</p>

        <p>In the past, application architectures were monolithic, tightly integrated systems forming a single,
            comprehensive application. However, such systems were expensive and difficult to maintain, resulting in
            numerous cycles spent on development, redeployment, and reintegration. Businesses need to remain agile,
            responding to both customer and industry needs in a timely fashion. To address some of these concerns, we
            have seen developers gradually moving from building monolithic applications to using containers and
            microservices. Microservices were introduced to create isolation and modularity in development, with a suite
            of code blocks acting in concert to form a single application.</p>

        <p>In addition, cloud providers offered a way to free companies from the need to host these applications
            themselves. Such serverless architecture removed the burden from organizations to manage their own physical
            or virtual servers, as well as any of the other platform components required for the application to run.
            With it, businesses were provided the means to quickly adapt to the needs of their customers and allow
            developers to be free to focus on their code.</p>

        <h2>What are serverless functions?</h2>

        <p>Serverless functions are one of the inherent features of serverless computing. These functions offer
            targeted, on-demand, and single-purpose application functionality that runs only when triggered by
            preconfigured events and for the time that they&rsquo;re required. This means that unlike the always-on
            product model of systems like database servers, you only pay for resources that you consume during function
            execution and nowhere else.</p>

        <p align="center"><img class="maxWidthScreen" alt="Figure 2. How do Serverless Functions Works?"
                src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/SF/How-do-SF-works.png" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2. How do Serverless Functions Works?</p>

        <p>As a developer, you create code for your serverless application. The serverless function code is then pushed
            out to a container registry. An event or a trigger is used to invoke the serverless function. When the event
            configured for a function occurs, the serverless function image runs as a container and executes the code.
            The function runs only when it is invoked, and you pay only for the resources and invocation time used by
            the application.</p>

        <p>Additionally, since these serverless functions are often hosted by the cloud provider, the organization
            doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about managing deployments or scaling. And self-contained, easier-to-maintain
            code means that products can be brought to market faster, freeing developers to focus on building and
            maintaining their applications without the worry of additional overhead. In the end, this translates to huge
            cost savings since you only pay for the resources that you need, when you need them.</p>

        <h2>Use cases of serverless functions</h2>

        <p>Serverless technology, like others in cloud computing, is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Consideration
            should always be given to how it will be utilized and whether it is appropriate for your organization.</p>

        <p>In general, if you&rsquo;re workload can be described by one of the following, a serverless approach may be
            for you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Easy to modularize for asynchronous and concurrent work</li>
            <li>On-demand utilization with potential uncertainty in scaling requirements for resources and
                infrastructure</li>
            <li>Stateless, ephemeral, and doesn&rsquo;t require instantaneous start-up times</li>
            <li>Business requirements that require fast development and deployment cycles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>More specifically, according to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) <a
                href="https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/tree/master/whitepapers/serverless-overview">whitepaper</a>,
            the top 10 serverless use cases include:&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b><strong>Multimedia processing:</strong></b> functions that operate on a file<br />
                A discrete, parallelizable task that runs infrequently and can scale in response to demand.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <italic>Examples:</italic>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users upload files, and you can execute the desired process in response to that upload, such as
                        transcoding video for different devices or resizing images.</li>
                    <li>An application accepts images as input and implements image recognition on it, such as for
                        document
                        verification, search by image, or as a payment method.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b><strong>Database changes or change data capture:</strong></b> functions that are invoked when data is
                inserted,
                modified, or deleted from a database.


                <p>Tasks that can vary in frequency and complexity.</p>

                <p>Here, these functions would perform in a fashion like a traditional SQL trigger, except that they can
                    also
                    perform a variety of parallel functions external to the database itself, such as invoking an
                    external
                    service (like sending an email) or updating an additional database.</p>


                <br>
                <p>
                    <italic>Examples:</italic>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring that any proposed database changes meet acceptable quality thresholds or other
                        requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Automatically translating data to another language after it&rsquo;s been received.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>


            <li><b><strong>IoT sensor input messages:</strong></b> functions that respond to messages from
                network-connected devices

                <p>Scalable tasks that can protect downstream services from sudden and drastic increases in load.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <italic>Example:</italic>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Efficiently and quickly filter, manage, and respond to <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> (MQ
                        Telemetry Transport) messages from reporting devices and scale in response.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>


            <li><b><strong>Stream processing at scale:</strong></b> functions that process data within a potentially
                unbounded stream of
                messages&nbsp;


                <p>Tasks that require high performance, scalability, and computationally intensive processing, but are
                    part of
                    non-transactional, non-request/response workloads.</p>

                <p>Here, functions would read and process messages from an event stream. In many cases, this would
                    require that
                    the data be compared against a set of context objects (e.g., in a NoSQL or in-mem DB) or aggregated
                    and
                    stored in an object or a database system.</p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    <italic>Example:</italic>

                </ul>

            </li>


            <li><b><strong>Chatbots:</strong></b> functions that provide customer engagement and query response while
                automatically
                scaling for peak demands&nbsp;

                <p>Scalable tasks that don&rsquo;t suffer from non-zero cold start-up times.</p>

                <p>People generally expect some delays when engaging in a conversation, so some latency due to
                    processing times
                    or service start-up won&rsquo;t adversely affect customer perceptions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Support and sales bots connected to organizational services can provide context-aware responses
                        to
                        product queries, support requests, or other service-related features.</li>
                </ul>


            </li>

            <li><b><strong>Batch jobs/scheduled tasks:</strong></b> scalable tasks that require intense parallel
                computation, IO, or
                network access for only short periods at a time


                <br>

                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A scheduled task such as a nightly backup job (e.g., cron jobs).</li>
                    <li>Jobs that send large quantities of emails in parallel.</li>

            <li><b><strong>HTTP REST APIs and web apps:</strong></b> functions that perform traditional request and
                response
                workloads&nbsp;

                <ul>
                    <li>Applications that provide individual REST calls (GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE) can scale
                        independently
                        and be billed separately, even if they share a common data backend.</li>
                    <li>Online instructional services (tutorials, testing, training, etc.) that run exercise code in an
                        event-driven sandboxed environment and provide user feedback based on comparisons with a set of
                        expected
                        results. Since an instance can be created for each user accessing the site, the system can both
                        scale
                        and charge independently for access.</li>

            <li><b><strong>Mobile back ends:</strong></b> functions that build a REST API backend workload above the
                Banking as a Service
                (BaaS) APIs

                <p>Scalable tasks that provide fast, on-demand service and/or quick development cycles when
                    time-to-market is
                    critical.</p>

                <p>This use case ties into the core advantages of serverless functions by allowing cloud providers to
                    manage
                    backend tasks while developers focus on providing services that both the customer and organization
                    require.

        <h2>Functions as a Service (FaaS)</h2>

        <p>Functions as a Service (FaaS) is a cloud services platform that allows customers to rapidly build and deploy
            serverless functions. FaaS allows developers to write code as self-contained functions executed in response
            to discrete events like image uploads or in-app events. The beauty and utility of the FaaS model are that it
            provides significant cost savings since these underlying functions are triggered as ephemeral events,
            naturally scaling on demand, and only using as many resources as are needed at the time. FaaS platforms are
            offered by most cloud providers and are increasingly being adopted by developers to reduce complexity and
            increase the velocity of development. Oracle Functions, AWS Lambda, and Microsoft Azure Functions are some
            of the FaaS offerings commonly being used by developers to build serverless functions.</p>

        <h3><b>Developer features</b></h3>

        <h2>Oracle Functions</h2>

        <p>Oracle provides you with a robust platform to easily develop and deploy serverless applications through
            Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Oracle Functions service. <i>Oracle Functions</i> is a fully managed,
            multi-tenant, highly scalable, on-demand, FaaS platform. This means that you can get the services and
            resources you need when you need them.</p>

        <p>At its core, Oracle Functions are built on enterprise-grade Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and powered by <a
                href="https://fnproject.io/">Fn Project</a>, Docker, and <a
                href="https://cloudevents.io/">CloudEvents</a>. <a href="https://fnproject.io/">Fn Project</a> is an
            Apache 2.0 licensed open-source engine. Fn Project is remarkably flexible. It&rsquo;s a container-native,
            serverless platform that can be run anywhere, either in the cloud or on-premises. Fn Project allows you to
            develop and test a function locally, then deploy it directly to Oracle Functions when you&rsquo;re ready.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of Oracle Functions</h2>

        <p>Since the architecture that Oracle Functions relies on is both serverless and scalable, it means that
            there&#39;s no infrastructure or software administration for you to worry about. Oracle Functions simply
            ensures that your app is highly available, scalable, secure, and monitored, leaving you to focus on
            delivering the best experience possible. Oracle Functions also allows you to develop in virtually any
            language (Java, Python, Node, Go, Ruby, or C#), letting you choose what&rsquo;s best for your application.
            For more advanced use cases, you can even bring your own Dockerfile. And the icing on the cake is that once
            you deploy your code and then call it either directly or trigger it in response to specific events, you only
            get billed for the resources you use on execution.</p>

        <p>All these features of Oracle Functions make them an ideal way to enhance the experience of both customers and
            developers alike. They not only make the deployment of new code quicker and easier to automate, but they
            also significantly decrease the possibility of downtime during deployment and let your services readily
            adapt to user demand.</p>
