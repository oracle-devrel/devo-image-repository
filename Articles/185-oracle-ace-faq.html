        <h3>What is the Oracle ACE Program?</h3>
        <p>The <a href="/community/ace.html">Oracle ACE Program</a> is designed to recognize and reward members
            of the Oracle Technology and Applications communities for their contributions. These individuals are
            technically proficient and share their knowledge and experiences through presentations, blog posts,
            articles, social media posts, community forum support and more. The Oracle ACE Program award is given for a
            one year term and past members are Oracle ACE Alumni.</p>
        <p>The program is comprised of 3 levels: Oracle ACE Associate, Oracle ACE, and Oracle ACE Director. The Oracle

            their community activities and aspire to contribute at higher levels. The Oracle ACE award recognizes
            established community contributors for their efforts. The Oracle ACE Director award is for community
            enthusiasts who not only share their knowledge (usually in extraordinary ways), but also want to increase
            their advocacy and work more proactively with Oracle to find opportunities for the same.</p>
