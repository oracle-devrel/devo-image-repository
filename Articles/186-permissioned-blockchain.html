        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>What is a blockchain?</h3>

        <p>In broad terms, a <i>blockchain</i> is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained within a distributed
            peer-to-peer (p2p) network of nodes. In essence, blockchains serve as a decentralized way to store
            information.</p>



        <p>Each of these distributed nodes maintains a copy of the ledger by aggregating transactional blocks that have
            been verified by a consensus protocol and signed with a hash (or cryptographic signature) that binds that
            block to a preceding one. This way, the network maintains an unbroken chain of events.</p>



        <h3>Key properties of blockchains</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Shared and transparent data access</li>
            <li>Immutable/tamper-evident ledgers</li>
            <li>Validated /non-repudiable transactions</li>
            <li>Confidential records and transactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of blockchains</h2>

        <p>Blockchain applications can be used for a variety of operations such as finance, supply chain monitoring, and
            identity validation. Depending on the application and the need of participating entities (security,
            performance, etc.) there are two types of blockchains available, permissioned and permissionless.
            We&rsquo;ll take a brief tour of both below and then explore permissioned blockchains in greater detail
            below.</p>



        <p><strong>Permissioned blockchains</strong> - Closed networks with limited decentralization, an additional
            access control
            layer, and designated entities</p>

        <p><strong>Permissionless blockchains - </strong>Open, decentralized networks with universal consensus
            validation; anyone
            can join the network and possess a copy of the ledger</p>

        <h2>Permissioned blockchains</h2>

        <p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at permissioned blockchains. <i>Permissioned blockchains</i> are
            blockchains that are closed (i.e., not publicly accessible) or have an access control layer. This additional
            layer of security means that the blockchain can only be accessed by users with permissions. Permissioned
            users are only able to perform blockchain operations within the strict confines of roles assigned to them by
            the ledger administrators and require that they authenticate themselves through certificates or digital
            identifier methods. In addition, the roles would dictate what information a user would be able to access.
        </p>

        <h3>Aspects of a permissioned blockchain</h3>

        <p><strong>Decisions are authorized by a private group</strong></p>

        <p>Decisions are made by the owners of the network through a central, pre-defined level.</p>

        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

        <p>Permissioned blockchains provide the operating organization granular control over permissions, data access,
            and the scope of user roles.</p>

        <p><strong>Decentralization isn&rsquo;t fixed</strong></p>

        <p>Permissioned blockchains can either be fully centralized or partially decentralized. Its members typically
            decide on the network&rsquo;s level of decentralization and the mechanisms for consensus.</p>

        <p><strong>Transparency is not required</strong></p>

        <p>Unlike permissionless blockchains, permissioned blockchains do not need to be transparent. Transparency is
            optional, as most permissioned blockchain networks are specifically intended to not be transparent for
            security purposes. Levels of transparency usually depend on the goals of the organization running the
            blockchain network.<br />
            In the meantime, the ledger maintains a record of every transaction and the identities of the participating
            parties.</p>

        <p><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong></p>

        <p>Access to the identify of every transactional participant can be crucial information for private entities
            concerned with accountability and a provable chain of custody. Every change is tracked to a specific user,
            so network administrators can have instantaneous access to has made a change to the system and when.</p>

        <h3>Consensus mechanisms</h3>

        <p>Because of the structure of permissioned blockchains, they don&rsquo;t use the same types of consensus
            protocols as permissionless ones. Most commonly, organizations that deploy permissioned blockchains use one
            (or more) of the following three protocols: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), federated, or
            round-robin consensus.</p>

        <p><strong>PBFT &ndash; </strong>PBFT is an improved version of the original BFT protocol where all voting nodes
            much
            reach a consensus, but one or more parties are considered unreliable. In this model, a network&rsquo;s
            safety and stability are guaranteed so long as the required minimum percentage of nodes are behaving
            honestly and properly.</p>

        <p><strong>Federated (or Federated Byzantine Consensus) </strong>- In a federated consensus, there&rsquo;s a set
            of
            transaction validators trusted by each node in the blockchain that receives and sorts the transactions. Once
            a minimum number of these validators agree, a consensus is reached.</p>

        <p><strong>Round-robin -</strong> In a round-robin consensus, nodes are selected pseudo-randomly to create
            blocks. Once
            chosen, a node must pass through a cooling-off period before it can reenter the pool and be available again
            for consensus participation.</p>



        <h3>Advantages of permissioned blockchain</h3>

        <p>One of the most significant advantages of permissioned blockchains is the high level of privacy and security
            they can provide. Without a verified set of credentials and access, no user can access or alter transaction
            information without permission.</p>

        <p>Another advantage is flexibility when it comes to decentralization. It can be incremental or fully
            centralized, giving businesses more freedom to participate without having to worry about the risks
            associated with a highly centralized network.</p>

        <p>Permissioned blockchains are also highly customizable and can accommodate configurations and integrations
            based on an organization&rsquo;s needs. And with knowledge of every user and their actions on the network, a
            verifiable chain of custody can be established for every transaction.</p>



        <p>Lastly, these types of blockchains are both scalable and highly performant due to the limited number of nodes
            needed to manage transaction verifications.</p>

        <h3>Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain</h3>

        <p>While lack of transparency can be a potential point of concern for permissioned blockchains, the issue is
            usually mitigated by the implicit trust placed in the governing authority. In a business context, consensus
            mechanisms and the smart contracts that moderate transactions on the network are agreed upon by the
            participating parties and maintained in secure, isolated containers. With this additional layer of
            computational security and measure of implicit trust, a properly provisioned permissioned blockchain can
            offset the security risk posed by bad actors.</p>

        <h3>Why permissioned blockchains are ideal for business applications</h3>

        <p>Many enterprise use cases require performance characteristics that permissionless blockchain technologies are
            presently unable to deliver because of limitations due to inefficiency and scalability. Additionally, in
            instances where permissioned blockchains are replacing existing secure, centralized networks, the identity
            of the participants is an essential requirement, such as in the case of financial transactions where
            Know-Your-Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and supply-chain provenance regulations must be
            followed.</p>



        <p>In general, then, for a blockchain network to be ready for enterprise use, it should possess the following
            requirements:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Participants must be identified/identifiable</li>
            <li>Networks need to be permissioned</li>
            <li>High transaction throughput performance</li>
            <li>Low latency of transaction confirmation</li>
            <li>Privacy and confidentiality of transactions and data pertaining to business transactions</li>
        </ul>



        <h3>Business value</h3>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s quickly review and see how permissioned blockchains stack up against these requirements. In terms
            of added value, permissioned blockchains:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Increase business velocity by accelerating transactions, enabling new business models and revenue
                streams</li>
            <li>Automate multi-party business processes</li>
            <li>Reduce the cost and risk of using intermediaries</li>
            <li>Reduce the cost of fraud and regulatory compliance</li>
            <li>Improve data quality and timeliness by avoiding offline reconciliation and manual exception handling
            </li>
            <li>Increase auditability and trust; reduce audit costs</li>
        </ul>



        <p>Comparing the two, permissioned blockchains are well positioned to achieve all the stated business
            requirements.</p>



        <h3>Use case examples</h3>

        <p>So, how are permissioned blockchains being used by businesses? While still an emerging business model, they
            have already found a wide variety of applications. Permissioned blockchains have been used to manage supply
            chains, create contracts, handle claims, verify payment between parties, and administer user identity.</p>

        <h2>Oracle Blockchain Platform (OBP) &ndash; extending the paradigm</h2>

        <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve explored permissioned blockchains and the ways in which they can be ideal for business,
            let&rsquo;s take a quick look at how Oracle is adding value to the blockchain platform. The Oracle Cloud
            Infrastructure Blockchain Platform is a tokenless managed blockchain service for running smart contracts and
            maintaining a tamper-proof distributed ledger. Built on the open source <a
                href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>, it simplifies the development of
            secure and verifiable applications that share immutable, trusted data with third parties such as suppliers
            and financial institutions. OBP goes further by extending Hyperledger Fabric with several enhancements for
            greater resilience, performance, scalability, security, manageability, and enterprise integration.</p>



        <p>As a preassembled Platform as a Service (PaaS), OBP includes all the dependencies required to support a
            blockchain network: compute, storage, containers, identity services, event services, and management
            services. OBP is deeply integrated with foundational services in Oracle Cloud and provides additional
            capabilities (e.g., REST proxy for synchronous transactions and an operations console with several
            configuration, administration, and monitoring capabilities) while maintaining compatibility with Hyperledger
            Fabric at the protocol and API level.</p>



        <p>Additionally, OBP includes the blockchain network console to support integrated operations. This helps you
            start developing applications within minutes and enables you to complete a proof of concept in days or weeks
            rather than months.</p>

        <h2>Glossary of terms</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consensus protocol</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A consensus mechanism is the way in which blockchains come into agreement about how transactions are
            processed and immutably stored on the platform.</p>



        <p>Since blockchains are dynamic and constantly changing states, the shared ledger technologies that they rely
            upon require an efficient, reliable, and secure mechanism to ensure that all the transactions occurring on
            the network are genuine and that all participants agree on the state of the ledger. This way, ledgers are
            protected against potential threats or anomalous states by reaching a mutual agreement about how the ledger
            should look.</p>



        <p>At its core, the consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant set of rules that decides on the legitimacy of
            contributions made by the various participants of the blockchain.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distributed ledger</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A distributed ledger is a database that is synchronously shared across different nodes in a network. It helps
            retain a record of transactions or contracts that have been created by participants in the system.</p>

        <p>Participating nodes are expected to be able to access the shared ledger and possess an identical copy of it.
            Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Smart contract</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Smart contracts are essentially self-executing pieces of business logic that mediate a specific transaction
            on the blockchain.</p>



        <p>Contained within the code of the transaction is details of the agreement between each of the participants.
            This code autonomously controls the execution of the smart contract and ensures transactions are trackable
            and irreversible.</p>
