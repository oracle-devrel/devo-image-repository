        <p>Setting up a Kubernetes environment can be quite challenging, especially for beginners. Rather than
            concerning yourself with manually installing Kubernetes on cluster environments, you could go for a managed,
            cloud option. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides the latest managed Kubernetes offering.</p>

        <p>This article shows how to deploy an example Java Platfrom, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application in a
            managed Oracle Cloud Kubernetes cluster.</p>

        <h3>Docker Containers</h3>

        <p>In order to run enterprise applications in a Kubernetes cluster, they need to be packaged as Docker
            containers. We will use a Docker base image that already contains the application server, a Java
            installation, and the required operating system binaries.</p>

        <p>The following shows the Dockerfile of our <a href="https://github.com/sdaschner/hello-cloud/tree/oke-example"
                target="_blank">hello-cloud project</a>:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
FROM sdaschner/open-liberty:javaee8-jdk8-b2

COPY target/hello-cloud.war $DEPLOYMENT_DIR
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We can distribute the created Docker image via the public DockerHub, another Docker registry cloud service.
            or a private Docker registry.</p>

        <h3>Kubernetes Deployments</h3>

        <p>Kubernetes runs Docker containers in the form of pods. A pod contains one or more containers and is usually
            created and managed by a Kubernetes deployment. A deployment provides the ability to scale and update pods
            without too much manual effort.</p>

        <p>Our example Kubernetes deployment&#39;s YAML definition looks as follows:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: hello-cloud
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-cloud
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-cloud
        image: docker.example.com/hello-cloud:1
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            port: 9080
            path: /
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            port: 9080
            path: /hello-cloud/resources/health
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regsecret
      restartPolicy: Always
---
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The liveness and readiness probe definitions tell Kubernetes when the container is up and running and enable
            it to handle incoming traffic, respectively. The deployment will cause one pod to be created on a cluster
            node with given the specification.</p>

        <p>In order to pull the image from our repository&mdash;here, <code
                class="ocode">docker.example.com</code>&mdash;we usually have to provide a Kubernetes secret, which
            contains the Docker credentials. The secret <code class="ocode">regsecret</code> was created in the same
            namespace for this purpose.</p>

        <h3>Services</h3>

        <p>To access the created pod from inside or outside of the cluster, we require a Kubernetes service. The service
            balances the load to all instances of the running containers:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hello-cloud
  labels:
    app: hello-cloud
spec:
  selector:
    app: hello-cloud
  ports:
    - port: 9080
      name: http
---
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Kubernetes connects the service to the created pods by their labels and the defined selector. The <code
                class="ocode">app</code> selector is a de facto standard for grouping logical applications.</p>

        <p>Kubernetes has an internal DNS resolution that enables cluster-internal applications to access our
            hello-cloud application via <code class="ocode">hello-cloud:9080</code>. This, by the way, is a big benefit
            of minimizing the URL conuration of applications that run inside of the cluster. No matter which cluster or
            environment runs our workload, the host name <code class="ocode">hello-cloud</code> will be resolved to the
            corresponding <code class="ocode">hello-cloud</code> service.</p>

        <h3>Ingress</h3>

        <p>To access applications from outside of the cluster as well, we usually use Kubernetes ingress resources. The
            following creates an NGINX ingress, which automatically routes ingress traffic through the external IP
            address:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
kind: Ingress
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: hello-cloud
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: &quot;nginx&quot;
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
        - path: /hello-cloud
          backend:
            serviceName: hello-cloud
            servicePort: 9080
---
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Enter Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes</h3>

        <p>In order to run our example application, we need a running Kubernetes cluster with an arbitrary number of
            nodes. Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes provides a managed cluster that doesn&#39;t require us to set
            up the Kubernetes resources ourselves.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengoverview.htm"
                target="_blank">documentation</a> describes how to create a cluster with a desired network setup. We
            will use the recommended default options with two load balancer subnets, three worker subnets, RBAC
            authorization, and an additional NGINX ingress deployment. For more information, you can also have a look at
            my <a href="https://github.com/sdaschner/oke-resources" target="_blank">GitHub OKE repository</a>.</p>

        <p>The following screenshots show the creation of our cluster with a default cluster node pool, which manages
            the compute instances. We are creating a cluster called <code class="ocode">oke-cluster-1</code> with the
            recommended networking options.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 1. Creating a cluster"
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-kubernetes-f1.jpg" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 1. Creating a cluster</p>

        <p>The node pool, <code class="ocode">node-pool-1</code>, is created with the worker subnets and will manage two
            nodes per subnet in <code class="ocode">VM.Standard.1.2</code> shape. In total, our cluster will contain six
            nodes in three availability domains.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 2. Node pool configuration"
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-kubernetes-f2.jpg" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2. Node pool configuration</p>

        <p>After that, our cluster and its nodes will be created.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 3. The created node pool"
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-kubernetes-f3.jpg" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 3. The created node pool</p>

        <p>The cluster detail page will guide us regarding how to connect to the newly created Kubernetes cluster. We
            can prove that our nodes have been created by using the <code class="ocode">kubectl</code> command-line
            tool:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$&gt; kubectl get nodes
NAME              STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION

129.146.126.186   Ready     node      2d        v1.9.7
129.146.133.104   Ready     node      2d        v1.9.7
129.146.136.107   Ready     node      2d        v1.9.7
129.146.66.171    Ready     node      2d        v1.9.7
129.146.98.185    Ready     node      2d        v1.9.7
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The cluster description page shows how to connect our local <code class="ocode">kubectl</code> with the newly
            created Oracle Cloud cluster.</p>

        <p>Once we confirmed that the cluster has been set up successfully, we can start using the cluster by
            provisioning our workload. Therefore, we send our Kubernetes YAML definitions to the cluster. In this
            example, we packaged the deployment, service, and ingress definitions into a single YAML file:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$&gt; kubectl apply -f deployment/hello-cloud.yaml
service &quot;hello-cloud&quot; created
deployment.apps &quot;hello-cloud&quot; created
ingress.extensions &quot;hello-cloud&quot; created
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We now can check that our service, deployment, and pod have been created successfully:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$&gt; kubectl get services

kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP          1d

$&gt; kubectl get deployments

hello-cloud   1         1         1            1           1m

$&gt; kubectl get pods

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The NGINX ingress service is exposed as a load balancer and we will use its IP address to access the cluster:
        </p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$&gt; kubectl get services --namespace ingress-nginx
NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                       AGE
default-http-backend     ClusterIP      10.96.76.149    &lt;none&gt;            80/TCP                        1d
ingress-nginx            LoadBalancer   10.96.191.202   129.146.88.24     80:30979/TCP,443:32339/TCP    1d</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Now we&#39;ll put it all together and access our hello-cloud example application via HTTPS, for example by
            using <code class="ocode">curl</code>:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$&gt; curl -k https://129.146.88.24/hello-cloud/resources/hello
Hello from OKE!
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>This uses the NGINX ingress that is accessed by the external IP address and routes traffic to the <code
                class="ocode">hello-cloud</code> service and ultimately to the container, which runs in the <code
                class="ocode">hello-cloud-d6777c66-n24bw</code> pod.</p>
