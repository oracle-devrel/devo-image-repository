        <p>In <a class="textLinks" href="/java/inside-java-mobile-app-part1.html">Part 1</a> of this series, I showed
            how developers can use the Java APIs (for example, JavaFX APIs) to create a Java client application that
            runs on desktop, mobile, and embedded devices using <a class="textLinks"
                href="http://www.gluonhq.com/products/mobile">Gluon Mobile</a>. I showed that with a 100 percent pure
            Java codebase, applications can be uploaded to the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.</p>

        <p>The app we created in that article was a standalone application. When the app ran, it didn&#39;t need any
            additional information, apart from what is in the application bundle. It goes without saying, but this is
            not a very common situation. In reality, most apps interact with back-end applications. Typical back-end
            interactions include the retrieval of weather information from a REST endpoint or of the financial
            transaction associated with buying a ticket and making a seat reservation for a concert. Because there are
            many Java developers working on back-end projects, these back-end systems are often familiar environments.
        </p>

        <p>The example demonstrated in the previous article presented end users with a selection of coffee types from
            which they could place an order. The list of possible coffee types was statically included inside the
            application. In this article, we will make this a remote interaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Mobile Apps Need Back-End Data and Functionality</strong></p>

        <p>We have a back-end system that provides the possible coffee types. By doing a REST call to a specific
            endpoint, the coffee types are returned in a JSON response:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>

        <p>There are a number of ways to connect a mobile app with an enterprise back end and to handle the
            interactions. In theory, you can directly use the tools that you use in enterprise systems to connect to
            other enterprise systems. In practice, however, this is not encouraged in most cases due to a number of
            reasons:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Although mobile devices have become more powerful, they still have fewer resources than servers do, and
                those resources need to be shared with other apps. Enterprise software is often designed with getting
                maximum performance from available resources in mind, rather than with sharing resources.</li>
            <li>Mobile devices are not always connected to the internet. Lots of boilerplate code would be needed to
                check if all requests are successfully retrieved and to optionally reschedule failed requests when
                connectivity is restored&mdash;taking transactional behavior into account.</li>
            <li>Mobile devices and apps have a specific lifecycle and need to behave according to specific policies.
                Some resources are conditionally available. The network might be a free Wi-Fi network or a paid cellular
                network. The battery might be low, and the app might be in the background. Depending on those
                conditions, an app should behave differently. Those conditions are not found on enterprise systems.</li>
            <li>Back-end systems typically don&#39;t want to allow any client to connect to them. Because mobile users
                can be connected via any mobile data provider or Wi-Fi network, a direct connection from the mobile app
                to the back-end system requires the back-end system to be accessible by every potential host on the
                planet. This increases the chances of attacks and security breaches.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Respecting Mobile and Enterprise Requirements by Using an MBaaS</strong></p>

        <p>A typical solution to overcome these problems is to position a mobile back-end as a service (MBaaS) between
            the mobile devices and the back-end system.</p>



        <p>Using an MBaaS, mobile devices don&#39;t connect to the back end directly; instead, they connect to the
            MBaaS, which may forward their request to a back-end system.</p>

        <p><a class="textLinks" href="http://www.gluonhq.com/products/cloudlink">Gluon CloudLink</a> is an MBaaS that
            can be connected to by mobile apps regardless of the way in which they are written. However, Gluon CloudLink
            works best when mobile apps are written with <a class="textLinks"
                href="http://www.gluonhq.com/products/mobile">Gluon Mobile</a>, the toolkit used to create the app in
            the previous article.</p>

        <p>Gluon CloudLink is a public cloud service that can connect to other back-end and cloud systems (see Figure
            2), but you can also install it as a service inside other clouds. In this article, I will demonstrate this
            using Oracle Container Cloud Service, which is part of Oracle Cloud.</p>


        <p><strong>Installing Gluon CloudLink on Oracle Cloud</strong></p>

        <p>If you have an Oracle Cloud (trial) account, you can install your own or third-party software in Oracle
            Container Cloud Service. You can configure a datasource (for example, a MySQL service or an Oracle Database
            service), and link it to your application(s) in Oracle Container Cloud Service. You can access more Oracle
            Cloud services, for example, you can leverage the storage capabilities provided by Oracle Storage Cloud
            Service. A great advantage of Oracle Container Cloud Service is that it supports a microservices
            architecture, and it allows for scalable applications. Gluon CloudLink is a back-end service that internally
            contains a number of microservices, and each of them can individually be scaled. Using Gluon CloudLink on
            Oracle Cloud allows you to scale the middleware according to your own needs. You have your own instance(s)
            running Gluon CloudLink, which connect to your own database service (the public cloud version of Gluon
            CloudLink is a multitenant service, where data is isolated between applications, but it is stored in the
            same data storage system).</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In the next article, I will explain the internals of Oracle Container Cloud Service,
            and I will show how a microservices product such as Gluon CloudLink can be installed and configured on
            Oracle Cloud. In this article, I will abstract away these internal details to simplify the discussion.</p>

        <p>Applications that leverage Gluon CloudLink can be managed using Gluon Dashboard, which is a web application
            that allows developers, architects, and operators to configure and monitor their mobile apps and the
            connections to the enterprise back-end systems. You can open Gluon Dashboard by navigating to <a
                class="textLinks" href="https://gluon.io/">https://gluon.io/</a>.</p>



        <p>By default, Gluon Dashboard will connect to the public Gluon CloudLink software as a service (SaaS)
            installation. Navigate to the Oracle Cloud&ndash;specific page at <a class="textLinks"
                href="https://gluon.io/oracle_cloud">https://gluon.io/oracle_cloud</a> to be able to connect to your
            privately hosted Gluon CloudLink instance in your Oracle Cloud infrastructure. In case this is the first
            time you want to use Gluon CloudLink on your Oracle Cloud infrastructure, Gluon Dashboard will guide you
            through the process of installing Gluon CloudLink on Oracle Cloud. You need to provide your Oracle Cloud
            credentials, and then the Gluon CloudLink framework will be provisioned on your own Oracle Cloud instances.
            Your data is stored in an instance of Oracle MySQL Cloud Service that is private to you. If you don&rsquo;t
            have an Oracle Cloud account, you can <a class="textLinks" href="https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit">sign up for
                a trial</a>.</p>

        <p>After you successfully authenticate in the Gluon Dashboard, the application will search for an existing Gluon
            CloudLink installation on your Oracle Cloud environment. If it doesn&#39;t find one, a dialog box will be
            shown proposing to install Gluon CloudLink on your Oracle Cloud environment, as shown in Figure 5:</p>



        <p>Click <strong>OK</strong> if you want to install the software. The required software will be installed on
            your account, and you can follow the progress in a console. This can take some time (for example, 15
            minutes).</p>

        <p>Once the Gluon CloudLink microservices are installed on your Oracle Cloud environment, you are redirected to
            the Gluon Dashboard landing view (Figure 6), which shows a menu and an initially empty usage graph.</p>


        <p><strong>Tunneling Requests Through Gluon CloudLink</strong></p>

        <p>There are many things you can do with Gluon Dashboard, but we will focus on getting the coffee types from our
            back-end system and providing them to the mobile app. If you select <strong>API Management</strong>, you can
            add a remote function. Let&#39;s create a function named <code class="ocode">otnCoffees</code> and provide
            the REST endpoint that will return the coffee types, as shown in Figure 7:</p>



        <p>When you click <strong>Save</strong>, Gluon Dashboard sends the information to Gluon CloudLink. Then, when a
            mobile app requests the <code class="ocode">otnCoffees</code> function, Gluon CloudLink knows what to do: it
            will invoke the remotely defined endpoint.</p>

        <p>Now, we need to modify the code for the mobile app so that it retrieves the list of coffee types by calling
            Gluon CloudLink. Currently, we have the service providing the data as follows:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
    public ReadOnlyListProperty retrieveOTNCoffees() {

        ObservableList list = FXCollections.observableArrayList();

        Platform.runLater(() -&gt; {

            list.add(new OTNCoffee(&quot;type1&quot;, &quot;Moka&quot;));

            list.add(new OTNCoffee(&quot;type2&quot;, &quot;Arabica&quot;));

        });

        return new SimpleListProperty(list);

    }</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We will now use the Gluon CloudLink client APIs and replace that code with the following code:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
    public ReadOnlyListProperty retrieveOTNCoffees() {

        if (otnCoffees == null) {

 DataClient dataClient = DataClientBuilder.create()

                .operationMode(OperationMode.CLOUD_FIRST)

                .build();

 

            GluonObservableList gluonCoffees = DataProvider.retrieveList(dataClient.createFunctionListDataReader(&quot;otnCoffees&quot;, OTNCoffee.class));

            otnCoffees = new ReadOnlyListWrapper&lt;&gt;(gluonCoffees);

              }

        return otnCoffees.getReadOnlyProperty();

    }</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this new code, we first construct a Gluon CloudLink <code class="ocode">DataClient</code>, which will
            manage the connection with Gluon CloudLink and beyond. The <code class="ocode">DataClient</code> is asked to
            operate in <code class="ocode">CLOUD_FIRST</code> mode, which means that it will first ask Gluon CloudLink
            for its data, and if a connection cannot be made, it will look into its local cache (on the mobile device)
            to present the data that was retrieved before.</p>

        <p>Next, the <code class="ocode">DataClient</code> is bound to the remote function named <code
                class="ocode">otnCoffees</code> and the result is expected to be a list of <code
                class="ocode">OTNCoffee</code> instances.</p>

        <p>The static method <code class="ocode">retrieveList</code> on <code class="ocode">DataProvider</code> is then
            called, and the data is stored in a <code class="ocode">GluonObservableList</code>, which extends the JavaFX
            <code class="ocode">ObservableList</code> by adding a few properties that contain information about the
            status of the retrieval.</p>

        <p>Note that we didn&#39;t have to provide a URL for the actual back-end service. This is all configured by
            using Gluon Dashboard in Gluon CloudLink, so once the mobile application can make a secure connection to
            Gluon CloudLink, we&#39;re all set.</p>

        <p>Gluon CloudLink defines a key pair for each mobile application, and in the case of a hosted version of Gluon
            CloudLink (as opposed to the public SaaS version of Gluon CloudLink), the host name needs to be provided to
            the mobile application as well.</p>

        <p>In Gluon Dashboard, the Credentials view allows you to store the required configuration file inside the
            resource directory of the mobile application, where it will be picked up by the Gluon Mobile tools that
            create the app.</p>



        <p>As can be seen in Figure 8, the required configuration is generated by Gluon CloudLink in a JSON format.</p>

        <p>On the client, we simply bind the call to the <code class="ocode">otnCoffees</code> function, as defined in
            Gluon CloudLink, to a JavaFX <code class="ocode">ObservableList</code>. By moving the configuration to the
            middleware, we avoid any risks related to changes in the URL structure or protocol, which would require a
            rebuild, redeployment, and redistribution of the mobile app. If you don&#39;t want to stress your real
            back-end system, you can also use Gluon Dashboard to send mock data back to your mobile client. The switch
            between mock data and the real data can be made by a single click in Gluon Dashboard, rather than by having
            to recompile and resubmit your app to the App Store and the Play Store.</p>

        <p>Note that we didn&#39;t create a separate thread for retrieving the data from the back-end system. This is
            done under the hood by the Gluon CloudLink client. The result is a JavaFX <code
                class="ocode">ObservableList</code> that can immediately be used by the graphical components in the
            client app&mdash;in this case, the list is used in a selection control.</p>

        <p>In this particular case, the three coffee types are likely to arrive quickly at the mobile app. But in case
            there is much data to be retrieved from the back end, using the <code class="ocode">ObservableList</code>
            allows developers to already render the retrieved data while new data comes in. Because Gluon CloudLink
            Client will populate the <code class="ocode">ObservableList</code> when the data is parsed, the visual
            control that is backed by this <code class="ocode">ObservableList</code> will be updated on the fly. This
            eliminates a huge amount of boilerplate code.</p>

        <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

        <p>In this article, we extended the OTN demo app from the previous article. Rather than showing a hardcoded list
            of coffee types, we retrieved the list from a back-end service. However, we didn&#39;t access that back-end
            service directly; we used middleware called Gluon CloudLink that bridges the gap between the mobile devices
            and the enterprise infrastructure.</p>


        <p>We explored how you can provision Gluon CloudLink on your Oracle Cloud infrastructure, and how you can easily
            configure Gluon CloudLink using its dashboard to map client requests onto external requests by defining
            functions that can be called on the mobile client.</p>
