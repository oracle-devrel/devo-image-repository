        <p>Can you easily replicate all the services your Java EE application needs to run? Every Java EE application
            needs many services: databases, message queues, NoSQL services, authentication, user management, and much
            more. We run some of those services inside the application server during development and small deployments.
            But once we grow and scale our infrastructure, we need to separate each service in its own environment.
            That's when things get complex.</p>

        <p>Software containers can help us manage and tame this complexity. Containers make it easy to create
            sophisticated architectures composed of many "moving parts." Containers also help automate this process, and
            ease the creation of complete development-test-deploy pipelines. Best of all, containers allow for the reuse
            of our infrastructure components. We can build infrastructures with containers from third parties, just
            adding them to our deployments. Or we can build infrastructures from the containers we create ourselves.</p>

        <p>We saw in the first article in this series how to encapsulate a Java EE application inside a container. Java
            EE gives us portability among Java EE vendors. Containers expand this portability to many infrastructure and
            cloud providers.</p>

        <p>Let's see now how containers can help us define our architecture in a modular, reusable way!</p>

        <h3>Enterprise Solutions Are Composed of Many Services</h3>

        <p>When we construct applications out of several services, we have important advantages. It is much easier to
            scale independent layers than it is to scale a single monolithic application. This is also true for our
            pipeline when we are creating development, testing, and deployment environments. Any discussion about
            "microservices" centers around those benefits. Separating large applications into modular services is
            technically sound and also fashionable!</p>

        <p>Not every application is composed of microservices, but the Java EE architecture does define and use multiple
            services. Lots of Java EE functionality is deployed on external services, which makes our applications much
            more useful and easier to create. And those services, although not microservices, are deployed (and scaled
            and developed) independently. This is part of what allows the Java EE architecture to scale to large
            environments.</p>

        <p>Figure 1 shows a Java EE application with multiple services, such as a web server, an application server, a
            message queue (MQ) server, and a database server.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 1. Multiple services that support a Java EE application"
                src="https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/modular-resuable-java-ee-architecture-docker-1.jpg"
                style="width: 720px;" /></p>
        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 1. Multiple services that support a Java EE application</p>

        <p>Almost every Java EE application uses many of the services shown in Figure 1 as well as SQL databases,
            message queues, NoSQL servers, user management servers, storage services, and many more. These services are
            independently installed and managed, and applications depend upon them.</p>

        <p>This usually means that we have to install, configure, and manage each one of those services. Many times,
            they will need to run on their own machines. If we want to scale or guarantee high availability (HA), we
            need multiple instances of each one, which adds even more configuration and installation hurdles to the
            whole process. It gets to the point that it is hard to re-create all those services in our development and
            testing environments. So we don't. This leads to different environments in our pipeline. Different
            environments increase the risk of failure and make debugging much harder—even if we are able to automate
            those disparate environments.</p>

        <h3>Encapsulating Services for Independence and Scalability</h3>

        <p>Containers are a great way to install and manage separate services. In the first article in this series, we
            saw how to encapsulate an application. We can also encapsulate any of those external services. Services
            inside a container are easy to install, manage, and scale. By running several containers on a single
            machine, we can develop and test our architecture. Once tested, we can separate the containers onto multiple
            machines and even replicate containers. With the same building blocks, we can create large, scalable, and
            highly available production environments. Figure 2 shows a diagram of a Java EE architecture built using
            containers.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 2. Diagram of a Java EE architecture built using containers"

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2. Diagram of a Java EE architecture built using containers</p>

        <h3>Modular and Reusable Services</h3>

        <p>Creating scalable and highly available architectures is already wonderful, and it is even better if we can
            reuse services that are already scalable.</p>

        <p>By accessing container repositories, we can compose architectures out of existing components, and we can
            reuse containers in multiple projects and environments.</p>

        <p>If we are using services that exist in the open source community or are provided by vendors, composing an
            architecture is even easier. There is a large pool of ready-to-use services prepackaged as containers, so we
            can compose our infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Many repositories of containers are available. Docker Hub is the leading repository, and it provide many
            (many!) images. But Google, Amazon, and others also provide public repositories. You can even host your own
            repository. You can search for an official (or not!) image of services, vendors, and products. The source
            code for most images is also available on GitHub.</p>

        <h3>Improving Our Original Application</h3>

        <p>Let's see how we can improve the application we created in the first article in this series. Building on top
            of our simple Java EE application that has an NGINX load balancer, we'll add several services.</p>

        <p>A typical enterprise application will need a database to store information. To talk with other systems in our
            enterprise, we can use a messaging server. We can integrate our application with legacy applications or even
            Internet of Things (IoT) devices. And, our application will be awesome, so it needs some big data
            capabilities. For this, let's add a NoSQL database to the mix. Figure 3 shows a diagram of the final
            application.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 3. Diagram of our enhanced application"
                src="https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/modular-resuable-java-ee-architecture-docker-3.jpg"
                style="width: 720px;" /></p>
        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 3. Diagram of our enhanced application</p>

        <p>If you want to follow along, all the commands and files that are mentioned here are at this GitHub
            repository: <a href="https://github.com/eldermoraes/javaoneus2016"
                target="_blank">https://github.com/eldermoraes/javaoneus2016</a>.</p>

        <h3>First, the Database</h3>

        <p>The most obvious thing for any Java EE application is the database. In this article, we are going to use
            PostgreSQL, an open source, powerful database. It can run in a cluster, so if we need to scale, we can run
            containers on multiple machines.</p>

        <p>A quick search at Docker Hub shows an official PostgreSQL image. We can use the container as is, or we can
            create a new image based on an existing one and add our own configurations. Let's do the latter to see how
            we can customize PostgreSQL for our specific application.</p>

        <p>We begin by building our PostgreSQL image. If you downloaded the project, change to the postgres directory
            and run the following command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker build -t postgres-javaone .
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Don't forget the period at the end. This command will build a new image based on the PostgreSQL Dockerfile,
            which was provided in the downloaded project:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    # Using PostgreSQL official Docker image as a basis FROM postgres:9.6  
    
    # Copy your local file init-user-db.sh to the image,  
    # as it will be executed when you run a new container 
    COPY docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-user-db.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-user-db.sh 
    RUN chmod a+x /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-user-db.sh  
    
    # Define default language for the database running  
    # from this image 
    RUN localedef -i en_US -c -f UTF-8 -A /usr/share/locale/locale.alias en_US.UTF-8 
    ENV LANG en_US.utf8
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We just built our own PostgreSQL image! We can use it in this or other projects. Let's start it and get it up
            and running:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker run --name postgresdb -p 5432:5432 postgres-javaone
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We are giving it a name, so we can access it from our application container. We are also exporting the port,
            so we can connect to it externally.</p>

        <h3>Now, Let's Handle Messaging</h3>

        <p>With the database taken care of, the next service our application needs is a message queue server. Many Java
            EE applications use Java Message Service (JMS) to route messages between components. It works inside the
            application or to reach out to the external world to legacy systems, external services, and Internet of
            Things devices. A good message server can connect our application to virtually anything. It can also deal
            with synchronous and asynchronous communication. Messaging is a powerful way of connecting systems in a
            decoupled way.</p>

        <p>Most Java EE application servers offer an internal JMS service. This can work. But the message server is an
            independent service, and you might need to scale it independently. An external server can also provide more
            options for connectivity. In our example, we will use Apache ActiveMQ. It supports many protocols and has an
            active community. More important: it is open source, so you can use in projects of any size.</p>

        <p>In this case, we will just run an existing image as is. A search on Docker Hub locates several images.
            Although there is no official ActiveMQ image, there are several done by the community. We selected one that
            looks well implemented. Now, we can just name the image in the <code>docker run</code> command, as shown in
            the following command. The <code>docker</code> daemon will download the image, create a container, and run
            it.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker run --name activemq webcenter/activemq:5.13.2
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>How About Some Big Data?</h3>

        <p>Our infrastructure is looking good! Today, every application needs some way to handle unstructured data or
            just large amounts of data. So, let's add a NoSQL server to our environment. That way, we are ready to
            handle some big data. Our little example app will shine!</p>

        <p>Again, searching on Docker Hub, we see an official image for Cassandra. We don't need any special
            configuration, so, let's just use this as is.</p>

        <p>Again, we don't need to build an image. We can just run it. As before, Docker will download the referenced
            image from the registry and run it:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker run --name cassandradb cassandra:3.7
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Isn't this fun? In just a few commands, we have a complete infrastructure ready for our application! Now we
            can go back to the image that we created (see previous article). That image is an appliance, which means we
            include in it the last version of our application, already deployed and ready to run. Let's make a few
            changes to that image, so we can use the new services we just deployed.</p>

        <p>To build the application container, we change to the following directory:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    javaoneus2016/tree/master/tomee-db
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>And then we build the image:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker build -t tomee-db --build-arg WAR_FILE=javaonedb.war .
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Here is the Dockerfile we are using in the above command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    # Using TomEE official Docker image as a basis 
    FROM tomee:8-jre-1.7.2-webprofile  
    
    # Configure our server with HA settings 
    ADD server.xml /usr/local/tomee/conf/server.xml  
    
    # Add some users to TomEE, so we can log in  
    # to the admin panel later to see the results 
    ADD tomcat-users.xml /usr/local/tomee/conf/tomcat-users.xml  
    
    # Add DataSource configuration 
    ADD tomee.xml /usr/local/tomee/conf/tomee.xml  
    
    # Add Postgres JDBC JAR file 
    ADD postgresql-9.4-1206.jdbc42.jar /usr/local/tomee/lib/postgresql-9.4-1206.jdbc42.jar  
    
    # Now we add our application.  
    # This is the last step, so we can use Docker caching capabilities  
    # every time we re-create the container with a new version of the application  
    
    ARG WAR_FILE=warfile.war 
    ADD ${WAR_FILE} /usr/local/tomee/webapps/${WAR_FILE}
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>So, now we have a new image with the latest version of the application. This version adds code to use all the
            services we installed.</p>

        <p>Note that this is a simple, standard Java EE application. There is nothing special in the application itself.
            We are just using basic Java EE constructs.</p>

        <p>In our JSP page we refer to a servlet that injects an Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) bean to access the database.
            Shown below is the relevant code for the JSP page, the servlet, and the bean.</p>

        <p>Here's the <code>index.jsp</code> file:</p>


        <img src="" alt="index.jsp code">

        <p>Here's the DataServlet file:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    //Inject the EJB 
    @EJB 
    DataBean data; 
    ... 
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {     
         data.create();     
         request.setAttribute("dataList", data.getData());     
         RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("index.jsp");     
         dispatcher.forward(request, response); 
    }
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>And here's the DataBean file:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    public List getData(){     
         return em.createNamedQuery(Data.FIND_ALL).getResultList(); 
    }      
    
    public void create(){     
         Data data = new Data();     
         data.setNameData(new Date().toString());     
         em.persist(data); }
         </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>As you can see, containers allow us to deploy virtually any Java EE application in this way. This is a simple
            example, and it is possible to do a more-sophisticated separation of an application into containers. We
            could even go all the way and create a complete modular microservices architecture. To get to microservices,
            creating containers for the major services is an easy first step. It requires hardly any changes in your
            application and provides immediate benefits.</p>

        <h3>Run, Java EE, Run!</h3>

        <p>There are already several containers up and running. PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and ActiveMQ are each running in
            their own containers. We can now stop, scale, and manage each one.</p>

        <p>All that is missing is the container that holds the application itself. We just built the image, but we still
            need to run the container.</p>

        <p>As we did in the previous article, from the appliance image we create the containers. We will run multiple
            containers to have a load balancer. We also need to link everything together, so the application can see the
            other services:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker create --name hostdb1 -p 8080:8080 --link postgresdb:postgresdb --link cassandradb:cassandradb tomee-db 
    docker create --name hostdb2 -p 8081:8080 --link postgresdb:postgresdb --link cassandradb:cassandradb tomee-db 
    docker create --name hostdb3 -p 8082:8080 --link postgresdb:postgresdb --link cassandradb:cassandradb tomee-db
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>And to finish, we add another important service: our load balancer. For this, we are still using the
            ready-to-run NGINX image by Jason Wyatt. (See the previous article for a more detailed look into the load
            balancer configuration.)</p>

        <p><code>docker create --name loadbalancerdb -p 80:80 --link hostdb1:hostdb1 --link hostdb2:hostdb2 --link hostdb3:hostdb3 --env-file ./env-load.list jasonwyatt/nginx-loadbalancer</code>
        </p>

        <p>Now that all the containers have been created, let's start them:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
    <code>
    docker start hostdb1 
    docker start hostdb2 
    docker start hostdb3 
    docker start loadbalancerdb
    </code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>That is all that we need to do to create a complete Java EE application with all the services it requires.
            The application can run in a single machine, as shown here. Or you can deploy it across a cluster. It can
            run on premises or in the cloud. It can run on your laptop for development and be automated in your
            continuous integration server.</p>

        <p>Containers allow us to have more-consistent environments. Having similar test, quality assurance, and
            production environments reduces risk and bugs. In production, we can even scale to multiple containers and
            multiple machines, guaranteeing high availability.</p>

        <p>This article provided a simplified example, but it outlines a robust process for experimenting with
            containers:</p>

        <p>1. Start from your own Java EE application.<br />
            2. List all the services you are using now: application server, database, message queue, and so on.<br />
            3. Docker Hub may have ready-to-use images for some or all those services. Do a search there, read about the
            images; look for the ones that are more suitable for your project.<br />
            4. Consider defining your own image. You might need to if there is no suitable image for a service or your
            application requires extensive configuration.<br />
            5. Either use the images directly (such as Cassandra and ActiveMQ in our example) or start from an existing
            image and add your customizations (as we did with the PostgreSQL image).<br />
            6. Start your containers to get your services up and running.<br />
            7. Create the container for your application. Remember to link it to the service containers. This will allow
            the containers to communicate. See the requirements of your orchestration platform.<br />
            8. Have fun! Enjoy your modular architecture with Java EE and Docker!</p>

        <p>Your infrastructure is now defined in containers. The next step is building your development pipeline. You
            can use those same images to run your tests and quality assurance procedures. Although that will need to be
            covered in another article, you already have everything you need to automate your whole development cycle!
