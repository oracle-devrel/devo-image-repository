        <p>Over the past years and months, interest in quantum computing has increased. On a regular basis, there are
            new reports from research institutes, companies, or governments about breakthroughs in this field. At the
            same time, articles with a less technical background talk about the potential consequences of quantum
            computing, ranging from breaking most of current encryption techniques to a fix for all diseases to complete
            general AI. Not all expectations are equally realistic, though.</p>

        <p>As a realistic, down-to-earth software developer, you may wonder where to draw the line between facts and
            fiction and how quantum computing will affect software development in the future.</p>

        <p>Clearly, we are many years away from production-ready hardware for quantum computing. However, the general
            principles are clear now, and abstractions allow developers to create applications that leverage quantum
            computing using simulators.</p>

        <h3>Isn&#39;t Quantum Computing Just Giving Us More CPU Power?</h3>

        <p>Traditional software development, using classical computers, translates a high-level programming language
            (for example, Java) to operations performed on a large number of (hardware) transistors.</p>

        <p>The simplified diagram in Figure 1 shows the flow of this process: Java source code is compiled into
            platform-independent bytecode, which is translated to platform-specific machine code. This allows Java code
            to work on different operating systems and architectures. The machine code leverages a number of basic
            operations (gates) acting on memory. The main hardware component to achieve this is the well-known
            transistor.</p>

        <p align="center"><img
                alt="Figure 1. Translation of a high-level programming language to operations performed on transistors."

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 1. Translation of a high-level programming language to operations
            performed on transistors.</p>

        <p>Performance improvements from the past decades have mainly been driven by advantages in hardware technology.
            The size of a single transistor has been reduced drastically, and more transistors per square millimeter
            allow for more memory or more processing power.</p>

        <p>Quantum computing is disruptive, because it doesn&#39;t use a classical transistor as the basic building
            block; it uses qubits, which we will discuss shortly.</p>

        <p>Not only are the basic building blocks different, the gates are different as well. Hence, the stack shown in
            Figure 1 does not apply to quantum computing.</p>

        <h3>Will Quantum Computing Destroy the Whole Stack Up to the Level of Java?</h3>

        <p>The short answer is &quot;not really.&quot; There is a growing consensus among scientists that quantum
            computers are particularly good for some problems, while classical computers are best for other problems.
            That should ring a bell: we see the same with GPUs versus CPUs. While GPUs use transistors as well, their
            operation is different from that of CPUs. However, many applications in a high-level language leverage both
            a CPU and a GPU under the hood. GPUs are very good for vector processing, and a number of applications and
            libraries separate work for the CPU from work for the GPU.</p>

        <p>This is, for example, the case if you are using JavaFX or Deeplearning4j. If you use JavaFX to create an
            application that has a user interface, you use Java code only (and maybe FXML to declare the user
            interface). When the JavaFX scene needs to be rendered on a screen, the JavaFX internal implementations will
            use shaders and textures and directly talk with the low-level drivers of the GPUs, as shown in Figure 2. As
            a consequence, you don&#39;t need to worry about what part of your code is best suited for the CPU and what
            part is suited for the GPU.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 2. JavaFX delegates work to the GPU and the CPU."
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-quantum-computing-f2.png" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2. JavaFX delegates work to the GPU and the CPU.</p>

        <p>As Figure 2 shows, the implementation code for JavaFX delegates work to the GPU and to the CPU. Although this
            is hidden for the developer (it is not exposed in the API), some knowledge about the GPU often is helpful
            for creating more-performant JavaFX applications.</p>

        <p>If you are using Deeplearning4j, a similar approach is happening. Deeplearning4j has a number of
            implementations for doing the required vector and matrix operations, and some of those leverage GPUs. As an
            end developer though, your code does not depend on whether you will be using CPU power or GPU power.</p>

        <p>It looks like quantum computers will be excellent in solving problems that typically require resources that
            scale exponentially with the size of the problem and are, therefore, hard or practically impossible to solve
            using classical computers. One of the possibilities experts are discussing is a hybrid form of execution: a
            typical end-to-end application contains classical code that is executed on a CPU, and it can contain quantum
            code as well.</p>

        <h3>How Can a System Execute Quantum Code?</h3>

        <p>Today, hardware for quantum computers is still extremely experimental. While big companies and presumably
            some governments are working on prototypes, those are not yet widely available. But even when they will be
            available, there might be different forms:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>A quantum coprocessor can be integrated with the CPU in a system.</li>
            <li>Quantum tasks can be delegated to quantum cloud systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although there is high uncertainty about the practical implications, there is a growing consensus on how
            quantum code should look. At the lowest level, this means the basic blocks can be described: a
            <em>qubit</em> and <em>quantum gates</em>. And as a consequence, <em>quantum simulators</em> can be built
            that implement the expected behavior.</p>

        <p>A quantum simulator is, therefore, a perfect tool to be used during development. The results it produces
            should be the same as the results on a real hardware quantum computer&mdash;but the simulator will be much
            slower since the quantum effects that speed up quantum hardware have to be simulated using classical
            software.</p>

        <h3>What Are Those Basic Building Blocks for Quantum Computing?</h3>

        <p>It is often relevant to compare classical computing with quantum computing. In classical computing, we have
            <em>bits</em> and <em>gates</em>.</p>

        <p>A bit can hold a single digit of information, and its value is either 0 or 1. A gate acts upon one or more
            bits, and it can manipulate those bits. For example, the NOT gate, shown in Figure 3, will flip the value of
            a bit. If the input is 0, the output of the NOT gate is 1 and vice versa.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 3. NOT gate."
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-quantum-computing-f3.png" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 3. NOT gate.</p>

        <p>In quantum computing, we have equivalents for bits and gates. The quantum equivalent of a bit is a qubit. A
            qubit&#39;s value can be 0 or 1, similar to a classical bit, but it can also be in a so-called
            <em>superposition</em>. This is a hard-to-imagine concept that tells us the qubit is in the 0 state and the
            1 state at the same time.</p>

        <p>When a qubit is in a superposition, its value is a linear combination of the 0 state and the 1 state. We can
            write this as shown in Figure 4:</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 4. Equation for when a qubit is in superposition."
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-quantum-computing-f4.jpg" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 4. Equation for when a qubit is in superposition.</p>

        <p>Note that qubits are often written in the <a class="textLinks"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra-ket_notation" target="_blank">bra-ket notation</a>, where the
            variable name is between a &quot;|&quot; and a &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol.</p>

        <p>The expression in Figure 4 tells us that the qubit <em>x</em> is in a superposition of the <em>|0&gt;</em>
            state and the <em>|1&gt;</em> state. This does <em>not</em> mean that it is in the <em>|0&gt;</em> state OR
            the <em>|1&gt;</em> state; we don&#39;t know its current state.</p>

        <p>It is really in both states simultaneously, and it can be manipulated as such. Once we measure the qubit, it
            will be in a single state though, either <em>|0&gt;</em> or <em>|1&gt;</em>. In the above expression, there
            is the additional limitation that <em>a^<sup>2</sup> + b^<sup>2</sup> = 1</em>.</p>

        <p>The values of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are linked to probabilities: there is an <em>a^<sup>2</sup></em>
            chance that, when measured, the qubit <em>|x&gt;</em> will contain the value <em>|0&gt;</em>, and there is a
            <em>b^<sup>2</sup></em> chance that, when measured, the qubit <em>|x&gt;</em> will contain the value
            <em>|1&gt;</em>.</p>

        <p>There is a strong limitation on the joy of quantum computing: Once a qubit is measured, all information about
            the potential superposition it was in is lost. The qubit will be either 0 or 1.</p>

        <p>During calculations, a qubit in a superposition can be both 0 and 1 (with different probabilities). If we
            have two qubits, those can represent four states (00, 01, 10, and 11), again with different probabilities.
            This leads to the real power of quantum computers. With eight classical bits, you can represent exactly one
            number between 0 and 255. All eight bits will be either 0 or 1. With eight qubits, we can represent all
            numbers between 0 and 255 simultaneously.</p>

        <h3>What Is the Benefit of Superposition, If You Can Measure Only a Single State?</h3>

        <p>In many cases, an algorithm has a simple outcome (for example, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;), but
            requires lots of parallel computations. By keeping qubits in a superposition during computations, it is
            possible to take into account all different options at once. Rather than doing evaluations for every single
            combination, a quantum computer can execute an algorithm on all options in a single step.</p>

        <p>An important step in many quantum algorithms is then to link the outcome of the algorithm into a measurement
            that gives a meaningful result. This is often done leveraging interference: The interesting results are
            constructively interfering with each other, while the noninteresting results cancel each other by
            destructive interference.</p>

        <h3>How Can a Qubit Be &quot;Transformed&quot; in a Superposition State?</h3>

        <p>Similar to how classical gates manipulate bits, quantum gates manipulate qubits. Some quantum gates resemble
            classical gates, for example, the Pauli-X gate brings a qubit from <em>a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;</em> state into
            <em>b|0| + a|1&gt;</em> state, which is similar to a classical NOT gate. Indeed, when <em>a = 1</em> and
            <em>b = 0</em>, the qubit is originally in the <em>|0&gt;</em> state. After applying the Pauli-X gate, this
            qubit will be in the <em>|1&gt;</em> state, as shown in Figure 5.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 5. Results of applying the Pauli-X gate."
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-quantum-computing-f5.png" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 5. Results of applying the Pauli-X gate.</p>

        <p>A very interesting gate is the Hadamard gate. This gate will bring a qubit that is in the <em>|0&gt;</em>
            state into a superposition: <em>1/sqrt(2)* (|0&gt; + |1&gt;)</em>, as shown in Figure 6.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 6. Results of applying the Hadamard gate."
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/java-quantum-computing-f6.png" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 6. Results of applying the Hadamard gate.</p>

        <p>After a Hadamard gate is applied to a qubit and the qubit is measured, there is a 50% chance the qubit will
            have value 0 and a 50% chance it will have value 1. If the qubit is not measured, it stays in a
            superposition until it is measured.</p>

        <h3>How Is All This Possible?</h3>

        <p>If you really want to know the answer to that question, a deep knowledge of quantum physics is required. But
            fortunately, you don&#39;t need to understand the theory behind this. While the idea of superposition may
            sound counterintuitive, it should be stressed that this is exactly how the most elementary particles in
            nature behave. Therefore, quantum computing is much closer to the physical reality of nature than you might
            think.</p>

        <h3>Should I Wait a Few Years to Start Looking into Quantum Computing?</h3>

        <p>You will be late in the game if you do so. In theory, it is possible to first develop hardware, and then move
            to the software layer and find out what can be achieved. However, the concepts are more or less clear, which
            allows quantum simulators to be written in popular languages, including Java, C#, Python, and others.</p>

        <p>Those simulators can then be used to work on quantum algorithms. While those algorithms won&#39;t have the
            performance gains that will be obtained when real quantum hardware is used, their functionality should be
            the same.</p>

        <p>Hence, if you work now on your quantum algorithm, you&#39;ll have time to create and improve it, and you will
            be able to run it when the hardware is ready.</p>

        <p>Quantum algorithms require a different mindset from classical algorithm. Very smart people started to develop
            quantum algorithms in the last century, and a growing number of algorithms are published now, including
            algorithms to factor integers, search lists, deal with path optimization, and more.</p>

        <p>There are other reasons why you may want to get involved in quantum computing today. Software systems in
            large companies typically don&#39;t get refactored overnight. However, one of the things that will be shaken
            by quantum computing is encryption that is based on the theory that it&#39;s close to impossible for
            classical computers to factor large integers into primes.</p>

        <p>Although it may take many years before quantum computers are large enough to make integer factorization
            easily solvable, as software developers we know it also takes many years to change systems and have them
            using safer technologies.</p>

        <h3>How Can I Learn More About Using Quantum Algorithms in Java?</h3>

        <p>You can download and use <a class="textLinks" href="https://github.com/gluonhq/strange"
                target="_blank">Strange</a>, an open source Java quantum computer simulator. With Strange, you can
            simulate a quantum algorithm by creating a number of qubits and applying a number of quantum gates to them.
        </p>

        <p>As a very simple example, let&#39;s create two qubits, <em>q[0]</em> and <em>q[1]</em>, that initially have
            the state value 0. We then apply two simple gates to each of the two qubits, which can graphically be
            represented as shown in Figure 7.</p>

        <p>The first qubit will encounter a Pauli-X gate first, followed by a Hadamard gate. The Pauli-X gate will bring
            it from <em>|0&gt;</em> to <em>|1&gt;</em> and the Hadamard gate will bring it to superposition, with equal
            probabilities for <em>|0&gt;</em> and <em>|1&gt;</em>. As a consequence, if we execute the circuit 1,000
            times, when we measure the first qubit at the end of the circuit, we expect, on average, to find that it has
            a 0 value 500 times and a 1 value 500 times.</p>

        <p>The second qubit is even simpler. We start with an Identity gate, which doesn&#39;t change the behavior of
            the qubit, followed by a Pauli-X gate, which changes its value from 0 to 1.</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 7. Example of quantum algorithm we can simulate using Strange."

        <p>We can create a simple quantum program using Strange that will verify our thinking.</p>

    }

 </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this application, we create a quantum program with two qubits:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>

Program p = new Program(2);

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We apply two steps in this program. In the first step, we apply an Pauli-X gate to q[0]. We don&#39;t apply a
            gate to q[1], which implicitly means we apply the Identity gate to it. We add this step to the program:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>

Step s = new Step();
s.addGate(new X(0));
p.addStep(s);
		
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>We then create the second step, in which we apply a Hadamard gate to q[0] and a Pauli-X gate to q[1], and we
            add that step to the program:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>

Step t = new Step();
t.addGate(new Hadamard(0));
t.addGate(new X(1));
p.addStep(t);
		
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Now that our program is ready, we want to execute it. Strange comes with a built-in quantum simulator, but it
            can also use a cloud service to execute programs in a cloud environment (for example, on Oracle Cloud).</p>

        <p>In the following sample, we use the simple built-in simulator, run the program, and obtain the resulting
            qubits:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>

SimpleQuantumExecutionEnvironment sqee = new SimpleQuantumExecutionEnvironment();
Result res = sqee.runProgram(p);
Qubit[] qubits = res.getQubits();		
		
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Before we measure the qubits (and lose all information), we print the probabilities. Next, we measure the
            qubits and print the value:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

            </div>

            <pre>
<code>

Arrays.asList(qubits).forEach(q -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;qubit with probability on 1 = &quot;+q.getProbability()+&quot;, measured it gives &quot;+ q.measure()));
	   
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you run this application, you&#39;ll see the following output:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

            </div>

            <pre>
<code>

qubit with probability on 1 = 0.50, measured it gives 1
qubit with probability on 1 = 1, measured it gives 1
	   
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Note that the measured value for the first qubit can be 0 as well, as we expected.</p>

        <p>If you run this multiple times, the measured value of the first qubit will give, on average, the same amount
            of 0s as 1s.</p>

        <h3>So Is That All There Is to Know About Quantum Computing?</h3>

        <p>Far from it. We didn&#39;t touch a number of important concepts such as entanglement, which allows for
            interactions between qubits even if they are physically far away from each other. We didn&#39;t discuss any
            of the known quantum algorithms, including Shor&#39;s algorithm that allows factoring integers into primes.
            Also, we ignored a number of mathematical and physical facts, for example, the fact that in a superposition
            |x&gt; = a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;, both a and b can be complex numbers.</p>

        <p>But the basic goal of this article is to give you an idea about the very basics of quantum computing and how
            it fits into your future software development.</p>
