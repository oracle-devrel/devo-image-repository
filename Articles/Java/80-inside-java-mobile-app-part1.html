        <p>Those of you who attended the Oracle Technology Network (OTN) Java Hub or demos during a few recent Java
            conferences (for example, JavaOne, Devoxx, and JFokus) probably know the coffee machine that allows
            attendees to order a personalized coffee, the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine that creates
            user-designed badges, or any of the other &quot;OTN Experiences.&quot; These OTN Experiences are
            demonstrations of end-to-end Java projects, spanning from embedded devices, through mobile devices, and onto
            cloud systems.</p>

        <p>The focus of this article is on building mobile applications that allow attendees to consume the OTN
            Experiences. <a href="/java/inside-java-mobile-app-part2.html">In a follow-up article, I will talk about how
                the OTN Experiences are connected to the web and how they are exposed using Oracle Cloud</a>.</p>

        <p>There are a few mobile apps in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store that provide the OTN
            Experiences. Recently, the OTN demo app was released to support the OTN Experiences at the JFokus
            conference. You can find it in the <a class="textLinks"
                href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/otn-codelounge/id1200292536" target="_blank">App Store</a> and in
            the <a class="textLinks" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gluonhq.otnexp"
                target="_blank">Play Store</a> For this article, we will create a standalone Java client application
            that works on desktop, mobile, and embedded devices (such as the Raspberry Pi), and that provides the same
            user interface as the apps you could use at the conferences.</p>

        <p>By using the <a class="textLinks" href="https://gluonhq.com/get-started/ide-plugins/" target="_blank">Gluon
                Mobile IDE plugin</a>, the Java client application can easily be installed on iOS and Android phones,
            without changing a single line of code. Gluon Mobile will adapt your code to the requirements of the native
            operating systems, and it leverages hardware-accelerated graphics using the JavaFX rendering system.</p>

        <h3>Getting the Demo App</h3>

        <p>For this article, we will use dummy back-end implementations, but as mentioned, in the next article we will
            replace this standalone behavior with the real cloud connection that is used to connect the mobile apps to
            Oracle Cloud and use the back-end functionality.</p>

        <p>The code for this application is available in the repository at <a class="textLinks"
                href="https://github.com/gluonhq/otnarticle1.git"
                target="_blank">https://github.com/gluonhq/otnarticle1.git</a>. Check out that repository using the
            following command:</p>

        <p>git clone https://github.com/gluonhq/otnarticle1.git</p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Then run the code using this command:</p>

        <p>/gradlew runt</p>

        <h3>Gluon Mobile</h3>

        <p>The screens you see in the application are primarily intended to run on mobile devices, so you&#39;ll note
            that when running them on a desktop, the aspect ratio of the window is a similar shape. This allows
            developers to develop and test on a desktop system before deploying to a real mobile device for testing.
            However, as noted, the Gluon Mobile software stack makes it trivial to get the code onto a real mobile
            device. Using the following command, developers with an Apple computer who have the XCode tools installed
            can easily run the application on an iPhone or iPad that is connected to their system:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>


  </code></pre>

            <div class="codeSamples"><code>./gradlew launchIosDevice </code></div>

            <p><code>If you don&#39;t have a device connected, but you want to see how the app would look on a mobile device, you can run the following command:</code>
            </p>

            <div class="codeSamples"><code>./gradlew launchIphoneSimulator </code></div>

            <p><code>Developers who have the Android SDK installed can install the app on their connected Android devices by running this command:</code>
            </p>

            <div class="codeSamples"><code>./gradlew androidInstall </code></div>
        </div>

        <p>Running the application on a mobile device is not hard, but it is beyond the scope of this article. If you
            experience any issues, refer to the <a class="textLinks"
                href="http://docs.gluonhq.com/mobile/latest/#_getting_started" target="_blank">Gluon Mobile
                documentation</a>.</p>

        <p>In the remainder of this article, I assume you are using NetBeans, IntelliJ, or Eclipse IDE and, for
            convenience, you already have the Gluon plugin installed. If you don&#39;t have the Gluon plugin yet, follow
            these <a class="textLinks" href="http://docs.gluonhq.com/mobile/latest/#_project_setup"
                target="_blank">instructions</a>.</p>

        <p>I use NetBeans in this article, but the other IDEs follow a similar approach.</p>

        <p>When opening the application in NetBeans, you can see that the application has a Java source section and a
            resource section. There are a number of iOS and Android sections, but because our application is completely
            cross-platform, we won&#39;t use them.</p>

        <h3>Edit FXML Views Using Scene Builder</h3>

        <p>The OTN demo application is a Java client application, and it uses JavaFX for rendering its UI. One of the
            benefits of JavaFX is that the UI can be decoupled from the application&#39;s functionality. A UI can be
            designed using the FXML markup language. The most popular tool for doing this is Gluon Scene Builder, which
            can be <a class="textLinks" href="http://www.gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder"
                target="_blank">downloaded</a>.</p>

        <p>Looking in the <code>resources/com/gluonhq/otndemo/views</code> folder, you will see that there are four FXML
            files, describing the four views in the application:</p>

        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Experiences</li>
            <li>About</li>
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Badge</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although not required, in this application, a View corresponds to a view in the mobile application. Each of
            those FXML files has a corresponding <code>Presenter</code> class that hooks the UI to the code.</p>

        <h3>The Java Code</h3>

        <p>The starting point of the application is the <code>OtnDemo class in com.gluonhq.otndemo</code>. This class
            extends MobileApplication and, thus, it can leverage some out-of-the-box functionality offered by Gluon
            Mobile to make the application instantly able to be deployed across iOS and Android devices.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> See the <a class="textLinks" href="http://docs.gluonhq.com/mobile/javadoc/latest"
                target="_blank">Javadoc</a> while reading this article.</p>

        <p>The OTN demo application overrides the <code> init() and postInit()</code> methods. In the
            <code>init()</code> method, the different views are registered. The four views that are defined in the FXML
            files and are controlled by the respective presenters are added to the list of views. Gluon Mobile manages
            the transition between the views. Once the views are registered, we can define a Layer to be used by the
            NavigationDrawer. The items to be shown in the NavigationDrawer are controlled by a flag called
            <code>AppView.Flag.SHOW_IN_DRAWER</code>. We add the necessary flags to the views while declaring them in
            the <code>OTNView class</code>.
        </p>

        <p>The Experiences view is the default view, and it is marked as the default view using the
            <code>AppView.Flag.HOME_VIEW </code>flag. Therefore, it will be shown when the application starts. The
            experiences.fxml file does not contain much content. But when the Experiences view is loaded, the
            <code>ExperiencesPresenter&#39;s initialize</code> method is called. This will create a
            <code>GridPane</code> that is shown at the center of the Experiences view. The <code>GridPane</code>
            contains two items, linked to two services that each has its own view: the <code>CoffeeView</code> and the
            <code>BadgeView</code>. Both the <code>CoffeeView</code> and the <code>BadgeView</code> have an FXML
            declaration <code>(coffee.fxml and badge.fxml)</code> and a controller class
            <code>(CoffeePresenter and BadgePresenter)</code>.
        </p>

        <p>By inspecting the differences between the coffee code and the badge code (both the FXML files and the
            Presenter class) you can see that there are a number of ways to declare content in a JavaFX application. The
            FXML file can contain all content, and the <code>Presenter</code> can be empty. The other extreme is no FXML
            file, with the <code>Presenter</code> taking care of all content. The coffee and badge views both use an
            FXML file and a <code>Presenter</code> class, but the balance of content in the FXML file versus the
            <code>Presenter</code> is different.
        </p>

        <p>The <code>coffee.fxml </code>file contains most of the view for the coffee service. Note that it contains a
            custom control for selecting the strength of the coffee, which was taken from the Medusa project created by
            Gerrit Grunwald. The <code>badge.fxml </code>file contains less content, and has most of its drawing code in
            the <code>Presenter</code> and in subclasses.</p>

        <p>The <code>FXML</code> files have a style class defined that is used to style the nodes in the respective
            views via<code> JavaFX CSS</code>. All the styles are defined in the otn.css file.</p>

        <h3>The Service</h3>

        <p>When the user is ready to order a cup of coffee or print the badge, a request is made to a back-end service.
            In this first version of the OTN demo application, we don&#39;t make a real connection to a back end.
            Instead, we have a Service class that mocks the connection to the back end. In a next article, we will
            discuss the real Service class that works with the real back-end systems.</p>

        <p>The methods for ordering a cup of coffee and requesting a badge to be printed are expected to make a request
            to the back end, which returns a unique identifier corresponding to the request. Our client application
            creates a quick response (QR) code based on this unique identifier, and then renders the QR code. The demo
            hardware that was used in the OTN demo areas read this QR code, and sent it to the back end to determine the
            details about the requested service.</p>

        <p>The fake Service class we are using in this article will return a random identifier, and a QR code is
            generated and presented to the user.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>Real-world applications are often more complex than simple demos or tutorials. A combination of multiple
            devices, hardware, and software should be taken into account. The data flow in an end-to-end application
            spans between embedded and mobile devices on one end and cloud systems on the other end.</p>

        <p>In this article, we explored how Java and JavaFX are very well positioned to be your favorite building blocks
            for creating Java client applications that work on mobile devices.</p>
