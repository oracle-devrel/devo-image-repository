        <p>Microservices have become one of the hottest frameworks for deploying digital technology in the past several
            years. <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/new-research-shows-63-percent-of-enterprises-are-a"
                target="_blank">63% of businesses</a> were using microservices architecture as of 2018. As such,
            business owners report microservices being an important part of their digital transformation strategy. </p>

        <p>Microservices aren't exactly a flash-in-the-pan tech trend, either. In 2020, <a
                href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/microservices-adoption-in-2020/" target="_blank">61% of
                businesses</a> had been using microservices for over a year. Microservice adoption is clearly helping,
            as well. Nearly 1/3 of businesses have been using microservices to migrate over half of their digital
            assets.</p>

        But what are microservices, though? How can answering “What is microservices architecture?” empower your
        business to make you and your employees more productive?</p>

        <p>Let's dig into this powerful new technology!</p>

        <h2>What are Microservices? A Definition</h2>

        <p>Microservices are at risk for concept creep as any other service. Maybe even more so as they're rather
            technical and their application is a bit obscure as well. </p>

        <p>Like any good math problem, we need to begin by defining our variables. To put it succinctly,
            Microservices.io define microservices as "an architectural style that structures an application as a
            collection of services."</p>


        <p>They go on to list some of the characteristics those services need to include. For something to qualify as a
            microservice it must:</p>
        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Loosely coupled</li>
            <li>Independently deployable</li>
            <li>Testable and maintainable</li>
            <li>Organized by business capability</li>
            <li>Run by a small team</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These specifications help limit the scope and make it more specifically clear what is or is not a
            microservice. Simply having an app with a number of different components wouldn't be a microservice, for
            instance, even though it would be set up very similarly. It could even be identical but it still wouldn't
            qualify as a microservice. </p>

        <p>This refined definition gives an idea why defining a microservice is so famously fuzzy. That's because it's
            not necessarily a product that you could put in a shopping cart and purchase. Like a number of other recent
            tech trends, such as AGILE or REST, microservices are a framework. They're more of a philosophy than a
            physical product. </p>

        <p>This microservices example should also help you visualize the entire development ecosystem. You can take a
            look at this GitHub repository for a real-world example of microservices in action.

        <h2>Further Characteristics of Microservices </h2>

        <p>Let's delve a bit further into some of the specifics of what makes something a microservice. Our previous
            list is a good starting point but it's a bit basic as it's only an overview.


        <h3> Microservices Must Be Self-Contained</h3>
        <p>For a component to qualify as a microservice, it needs to be fully functional completely on its own. A
            microservice must be self-contained and able to run of its own volition. Communication via other apps,
            services, microservices, and databases is accomplished via an application programming interface (API).
            The APIs which the components use to communicate over the network need to be lightweight for it to count as
            a microservice, as well. The API must dictate the microservice's functionality, also. This is the feature
            that allows developers to link microservices together into a larger modular environment.</p>

        <h3>Independently Maintained</h3>
        <p>One of the main reasons for microservices' popularity is their independence. For an application to qualify as
            a microservice it needs to be able to be updated independently without having to change the rest of the
            network or application.</p>

        <p>To make sure this independence is able to be maintained, a microservice needs to be tested and monitored
            regularly to make sure it continues to function as it's intended.
        </p>

        <h2>Reasons For Microservice Adoption</h2>

        <p>As we've said, microservices have been around for a while. Why has this software architecture format been so
            prevalent in recent years, then?</p>

        <p>One of the main reasons for microservices' surge in popularity is similar to the rise in AGILE we've talked
            about. These days, it’s fashionable for teams to be able to work as independently as possible. Efficiency is
            the name of the game, which means that teams need to be able to be small, work fast, and be eminently
            adaptable. </p>

        <p>Microservices also make sense from a pragmatic business standpoint. While specificity may have been the
            be-all, end-all of the Industrial Revolution, things have changed during Industry 4.0. Now, things need to
            be reusable, adaptable, and scalable.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Microservices</h2>

        <p>Microservices are one of the core components of cloud-based products and services. The ability to run
            software and services in containerized environments is the heart of the cloud-based infrastructure. This
            means that the principal benefit of using microservice architecture is it enables all of the benefits of a
            decentralized workplace.</p>
        <p>There have been encyclopedias worth of information written about the benefits of adopting cloud-based
            technology, at this point. We'll paraphrase to mention that microservices enable and empower your remote
            workforce. Your employees are no longer tethered to the physical office to use powerful business software or
            have up-to-date and accurate data.</p>

        <p>The accuracy is one of the main answers to the question "Why microservices?” Inaccurate data can derail your
            sales and marketing departments, undermining your employees' authority and casting doubt on your
            organization at crucial moments during the buyer's cycle. </p>

        <p>Scalability is one of the other main reasons to integrate microservices into your workflow if you haven't
            already. Never before has the business world been so unpredictable. The last year alone has been ample
            evidence of that. </p>

        <p>If a business hopes to not only survive but thrive in the 21st Century, it needs to be ready for anything, at
            any time. Stateless resources and scalability makes that possible.</p>

        <p>Microservices make it so that you can bump up your resources in case of an unexpected rush or surge in
            business. This means you don't have to pay for services that you're not using before you need them. It also
            means you can scale back once they're no longer necessary so you can keep your operating costs as low as
            possible. </p>

        <p>This makes microservices a blessing and powerful resource for startups and entrepreneurs. We don't all have
            the resources to pay for terabytes worth of cloud-based servers when we're first starting out in business.
            Especially if we're not going to need them for a number of years.

        <h2>Microservices Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Anytime a term starts to trend in the worlds of tech or business, you'll see a gold rush as people try and
            cash in on the trend. This muddies the water when everything and everybody are creating products and writing
            blogs talking about microservices. </p>

        <p>Not all of that advice is going to be accurate, unfortunately, let alone actionable. Here are some things you
            should keep in mind in order to use microservices efficiently in your organization.</p>

        <h3>Choose The Right Development Environment</h3>
        <p>There are a ton of cloud servers and cloud-based services at this point. While what constitutes the best
            cloud server is largely going to boil down to taste, you should still take the time to do some research
            before settling on what environment will best serve your needs. It's much easier to set up a server for your
            microservices correctly the first time than to migrate to a different service later on. </p>

        <p>Choosing the right environment to run your microservices sets you up for success. Popular microservice
            servers have a ton of powerful resources available from a microservice aggregator that are premade and ready
            to go. You just need to plug them into your microservices development projects and they're ready to go!</p>

        <h3>Automate Everything</h3>
        <p>Another one of the main reasons for microservices' popularity in recent years is the push to automate as many
            business processes as possible. Automation is good for everything from improving company productivity to
            increasing employee morale. </p>

        <p>Microservices make all of that possible. It also means there are a ton of powerful tools for automation like
            Java microservices, for example.</p>

        <p>Microservices are an essential part of automated testing tools. Microservices make it so that you can
            continually monitor the security of your network, for instance, so you'll be instantly made aware of any
            compromises to your security. It also makes it so that your microservice system can monitor itself, as well,
            so that doesn't become just one more task on your daily ToDo list.</p>

        <p>If you hope to be successful in today's business world, you need to be ready for anything. If we've learned
            anything from COVID-19 it's that absolutely every element of our working world is subject to disruption.
            Making sure your software, services, and productivity tools are just as available remotely makes sure that
            you, your customers, and your employees have everything they need to succeed is integral to future
            prosperity.
