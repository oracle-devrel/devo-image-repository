        <p>In this article, which is Part 1 of a series, we will look at how you can run R analytics at scale on a
            Hadoop platform using Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, which is a component of Oracle Big Data
            Connectors and provides a set of R functions allowing you to connect to and process data stored on Hadoop
            Distributed File System (HDFS) using Hive transparency as well as Oracle Database. Oracle R Advanced
            Analytics for Hadoop provides interfaces to Oracle Database, HDFS, and Hive and interfaces for initiating
            map-reduce jobs using by providing some simplified functions that abstract the underlying complexity away
            from the data scientist. Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop has a number of highly scalable machine
            learning algorithms and also utilizes some of the Apache Spark machine learning algorithms for greater
            performance of in-memory distributed machine learning.</p>

        <p>This article focuses on showing how you can get started with using Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop,
            how to access and process data in Oracle Database, HDFS, and Hive and how to create and manage map-reduce
            processes. In the <a
                href="https://developer.oracle.com/databases/oracle-r-advanced-analytics-for-hadoop-part-2.html">second
                part of this series</a>, we will look at how you can use the various analytic features, machine
            learning, and Apache Spark to process and analyze your data.</p>

        <h3>Overview of Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop</h3>

        <p>Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop is one of the components of the Oracle Big Data Connectors, and it
            provides a set of R functions that allows you to connect to and manipulate data stored on HDFS using Hive
            transparency. It also allows you to build map-reduce analytics and use the prepackaged algorithms exposed
            through an R interface. Additionally, you can integrate with Apache Spark and other tools and languages for
            greater performance for multilayer neural networks and for logistic regression. (Note: In Figure 1,
            &quot;Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop&quot; is abbreviated as &quot;ORAAH&quot; and &quot;SQL
            Developer&quot; refers to Oracle SQL Developer.)</p>

            in the Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop package:.</p>

        <h3>How to Get Access to an Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop Environment</h3>

        <p>When it comes to trying out Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, you have three main options. The first is
            to get it installed on some of your existing servers that have Hadoop, Hive, and access to Oracle Database.
            If such an environment is not easily accessible, alternatively, you can use one of the Oracle VM VirtualBox
            prebuilt virtual machines. The virtual machine called Oracle Big Data Lite VM comes with a large number of
            Oracle products installed on it including Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, Oracle Database12c,
            Hadoop, HBase, Hive, Impala, Kafta, and so on. This virtual machine is continually being updated with the
            latest version of this software, and it can be downloaded from the following website: <a
                href="//www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html">https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html</a>.
        </p>

        <p>As a third option, Oracle Big Data Cloud Service comes with Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop installed
            along with many of the products that are on the Oracle Big Data Lite VM. Check the following web page to see
            what cloud services are available: <a
                href="https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/big-data">https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/big-data</a>.</p>

        <h3>Working with Data Across Datasources</h3>

        <p>Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop allows you to work seamlessly across many different locations for your
            data including Oracle Database, Hive, and HDFS, as shown in Figure 2. In this article, I will illustrate how
            you can use it to access and process data on each of these datasources.</p>

        <p align="center"><img
                alt="Figure 2: Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop working with data across many datasources"
                src="//www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/oracle-r-advanced-analytics-for-hadoop-part-1-f2.gif" /></p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2: Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop working with data across many
            datasources.</p>

        <p>The first example of using Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop is with data located in Oracle Database.
            The following example code begins with loading the R package for Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop,
            which is called <code class="ocode">ORCH</code>. It then downloads a CSV file from the internet that
            contains Beach Quality inspection reports for beaches located in Dublin, Ireland. This dataset will be used
            in each of the examples to illustrate the moving of data between each of the data storage environments. When
            this data is loaded into Oracle Database, you can use many of the R functions to inspect this data. The
            following code illustrates the loading and usage this dataset.</p>

        <p>For our first step, we can load Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop using the <code
                class="ocode">ORCH</code> package and then download the dataset from the internet.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# load the Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop library
library(ORCH)

# download the CSV file to the local environment and examine the data
data &lt;- read.csv(
    file=url(&quot;http://data.fingal.ie/datasets/csv/BathingWaterStatus.csv&quot;),
    head=TRUE, sep=&quot;,&quot;)
class(data)
head(data)
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>After loading the data into the local R environment, you can connect to a schema in Oracle Database:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# connect to Oracle Database
ore.connect(user=&quot;odmuser&quot;, sid=&quot;orcl&quot;, host=&quot;localhost&quot;, password=&quot;odmuser&quot;, port=1521, all=TRUE);
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>You can now save the local R data frame, containing the beach quality data, into your Oracle schema by
            creating new table. The <code class="ocode">ore.create()</code> command creates a table in the database and
            uses the data in the R data frame (called <code class="ocode">data</code>) into this table. This new table
            can now be referenced in the R session.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# save the R data frame as a table in the database
ore.create(data, table=&quot;DUBLIN_BEACH_QUALITY&quot;)
# refresh the list of database objects
ore.attach()
# list the objects in the database. The newly created table is listed
ore.ls()
class(DUBLIN_BEACH_QUALITY)
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>After the table has been created, you can use it as a proxy data frame (also called an ORE data frame) and
            run all your typical R functions on this data. But in this case, these R functions, via the ORE transparency
            layer, are being run on the data in the table in Oracle Database instead of in the local R environment. This
            allows you to use the benefits of Oracle Database. The following codes illustrates using some of the
            traditional R functions to analyze the data in the Oracle table.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# this table can be used in the same way as a tradition R data frame,
# but the data remains in the database. Only results are returned to your R 
# session
summary(DUBLIN_BEACH_QUALITY)
head(DUBLIN_BEACH_QUALITY)
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The R code above illustrates how easy it is to work with data in the local R session and with data in Oracle
            Database.</p>

        <p>But what about when you want to work with data in HDFS? Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop has number of
            R functions that facilitate this. Table 1 lists the functions for working with HDFS.</p>

        <h3>Map-Reduce Using Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop</h3>

        <p>Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop comes with a number of functions that allow you to create and manage
            map-reduce jobs in Hadoop. A map-reduce process takes a dataset that has been distributed over Hadoop,
            performs analysis on the distributed dataset, and finally calculates and returns the results. This allows
            you to utilize many of the CRAN packages and invoke these as Hadoop jobs from R.</p>

        <p>With the <code class="ocode">ORCH</code> package, you can define a map-reduce job and submit it using the
            <code class="ocode">hadoop.exec()</code> function. Table 2 lists the various functions map-reduce function
            for ORAAH. There are three main steps to define a map-reduce job in <code class="ocode">ORCH</code>.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:40px;">1. Define the dataset you are going to use. This dataset can exist on Hadoop, in
            Hive, or as an R object.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:40px;">2. Define the mapper function. This allows you to define what data you want to be
            selected from the dataset and used in the later steps.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:40px;">3. Specify how to apply the reducer function. This is the function to be applied to
            the selected data. The output from this will be results from applying the reducer function or calculation.
