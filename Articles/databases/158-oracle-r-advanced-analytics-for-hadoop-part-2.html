        <p>In this article, which is Part 2 of a series, we will look at some of the more advanced features of Oracle R
            Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, including advanced analytics and machine learning, and how to use Spark.
            Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop is a component of Oracle Big Data Connectors and provides a set of R
            functions allowing you to connect to and process data stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), using
            Hive transparency, as well as data stored in Oracle Database.</p>

        <p>In <a href="/learn/technical-articles/oracle-r-advanced-analytics-for-hadoop-part-1">Part 1
                of this series</a>, we looked at some of the more typical use cases for using Oracle R Advanced
            Analytics for Hadoop, including working with Oracle Database, HDFS, and Hive and initiating map-reduce jobs.
            Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop has a number of highly scalable machine learning algorithms and
            utilizes some of the Apache Spark machine learning algorithms for greater performance of in-memory
            distributed machine learning. This will be the focus of this article.</p>

        <h3>Analytical and Machine Learning Features in Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop</h3>

        <p>When using Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, you also have access to the wide range of analytic
            functions available from the many thousands of R packages. It would take a very long time to cover all of
            those here, but when we look closer at what analytic functions are specific to Oracle R Advanced Analytics
            for Hadoop, we find the functions listed in Table 1. To find this list, you can use the following R command
            once the <code class="ocode">ORCH</code> package has been loaded.</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: * These are Spark-enabled versions of the functions.</p>
        <p>With each release or Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, you will find that the list of analytic and
            machine learning functions will increase. These functions have been specifically tuned to work in big data
            environments with data in HDFS and Hive. This allows these functions to be available for scaling using
            map-reduce jobs as well as for improvements in memory usage and so on.</p>
        <p>The following example illustrates the creation of a linear regression model, using the <code
                class="ocode">orch.lm()</code> function, using the on-time flight dataset.</p>

        <div class="ocode">

# 
# Map-Reduce is used to scale the processing to create the model

            for each function to ensure that you are maximizing them fully.</p>

        <h3>Spark Machine Learning Feature in Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop</h3>

        <p>Over the past few releases of Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, Oracle has been increasing the support
            for using Spark. By doing this, Oracle is making it easier to access and use the various machine learning
            functions available in Spark, thereby utilizing their memory-resident efficiency. Additionally, some of the
            HDFS functions have been updated to allow data to be easily transferred from Spark RDDs into HDFS. Similarly
            these Spark-based functions can be run on data stored in HDFS and Hive. Table 2 lists the Spark-enabled
            functions in Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop (version 2.7.1).</p>

        </table><br />

        <p>It is expected that the list of functions in Table 2 will be expanded with each subsequent release of Oracle
            R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop.</p>
        <p>Additionally, some Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop functions have been updated to support the use of
            these algorithms in Spark. These include an updated <code class="ocode">predict()</code> function for
            scoring new datasets using the Spark-based models. The <code class="ocode">orch.save.model()</code> function
            saves the Spark-based model details to a file in HDFS. This allows the model to be saved for later use or
            for sharing with other data scientists. The <code class="ocode">orch.load.model()</code> function can then
            be used to reload the Spark model back into the environment.</p>
        <p>To enable access to Spark from your R and Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop environment, it is important
            that you have Spark installed and the necessary environment variables enabled to make it accessible. This
            can be easily configured by editing the <code class="ocode">Renviron.site</code> file to ensure that the
            <code class="ocode">SPARK_HOME</code> and <code class="ocode">SPARK_JAVA_OPTS</code> environment variables
            are set and to ensure that the necessary Spark directories are included in the <code
                class="ocode">CLASSPATH</code>. Some of this setup is dependent on your environment. The working
            environment for the articles in this series is the Oracle VM VirtualBox prebuilt virtual machine called
            Oracle Big Data Lite VM (see Part 1 for more information).
        </p>
        <p>The first step is to create a Spark connection. A Spark connection can be set up to use Yarn or it can be set
            up in a standalone mode. The following example illustrates the <code class="ocode">spark.connect()</code>
            function. This function has four parameters:</p>
        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>The first is to define if you are going to use Yarn or standalone mode. This first parameter is called
                the master.</li>
            <li>The second (optional) parameter is a name variable that helps centralize logging in the session on the
                Spark master. By default, this is set to <code class="ocode">ORCH</code> and does not need to be defined
                in the call to the function.</li>
            <li>The third parameter is used to define the amount of memory to allocate per Spark worker for this Spark
                context.</li>
            <li>The fourth parameter, <code class="ocode">dfs.namenode</code>, points to the HDFS namenode server in
                order to exchange information with HDFS.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# Load the ORCH R package 
library(ORCH) 

# Create the Spark connection using Yarn 
spark.connect("yarn-client", 
               memory="512m", 
               dfs.namenode="bigdatalite.localdomain")
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>After the Spark connection is set up, you can proceed to process the data and run the Spark-enabled
            algorithms that you need to use. The following example illustrates using the Spark algorithm <code
                class="ocode">orch.glm2()</code> to fit a model for the kyphosis dataset that is part of the <code
                class="ocode">rpart</code> R package.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

            </div>

            <pre>

# It will be this dataset that will be used with Spark

# List the contents of the default directory in HDFS 
# and verify the file exists
hdfs.ls()

# Call the Spark-enabled GLM2 function to generate the 
# machine learning model
sparkModel &lt;- orch.glm2(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, 
                        dfs.dat = dfs.dat)

        </div>

        <p>The GLM2 Spark model can be saved to HDFS using the <code class="ocode">orch.save.model</code> function. This
            function takes the name of the model as the first parameter and the name of the file in HDFS as the second
            parameter.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>

            <pre>
<code>
orch.save.model(sparkModel, "sparkmodel_hdfs", overwite=TRUE)
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>When you want to reuse the saved model, you can use the <code class="ocode">orch.load.model</code> function
            to load the model details back into your R environment, for example:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
modelReloaded &lt;- orch.load.model("sparkmodel_hdfs")
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>When you are finished performing your analytics and machine learning using Spark, you can close the
            connection using the <code class="ocode">spark.disconnect</code> function. This function does not delete the
            current Spark context but instead marks it as nonactive. Within a short time, all resources will be freed up
            by the R environment and Java garbage collectors.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
