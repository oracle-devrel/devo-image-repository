            | of
            this
            series explains how to develop Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces for Oracle Database
            data
            using <a

                REST Data Services</a>, a mid-tier Java application that can be deployed to a Java EE application
            server
            or run in standalone mode. The examples provided illustrate how you can create a RESTful service on a
            database table or view and then consume that service from within Python code. Working through the
            examples,
            you will see different Oracle REST Data Services options in action. In particular, you will learn how an
            Oracle REST Data Services RESTful service can be created with just a few clicks and how you can manually
            build it, maintaining the necessary level of flexibility and customizability.</p>

        <p>This part provides a brief overview of Oracle REST Data Services, as well as how to get started with it
            and
            quickly learn how to build on its foundations. In particular, it covers how to develop a RESTful
            service,
            using <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/overview/index.html">Oracle

        <h3>Why REST?</h3>

        <p>REST is an architectural style used in web development to unify the way in which applications interact
            with
            their data sources. To access and manipulate data, REST-based applications use a standard set of HTTP
            request methods, including GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.</p>

        <p>The REST architecture assumes that an application does not interact with its underlying data source
            directly,
            but uses a RESTful web service in between. Such a service receives a request from the application, maps
            it
            to the corresponding operation performed against the underlying data source, and sends the retrieved
            results&mdash;if the operation is supposed to retrieve results&mdash;back to the application.</p>

        <p>So, the implementation of data-handling operations is specific to an underlying data source and is
            defined in
            a RESTful service. It is fairly obvious that this design enables developing highly portable
            applications.
            You can switch from one data source to another without having to modify your application code.</p>

        <h3>A Brief Overview of Oracle REST Data Services</h3>

        <p>Oracle REST Data Services provides an easy way to build RESTful services that enable REST access to data
            in
            Oracle Database, an Oracle Database 12c JSON document store, and Oracle NoSQL Database. Being a Java
            EE&ndash;based application, Oracle REST Data Services can be deployed to a Java EE application server,
            including Oracle WebLogic Server, GlassFish Server, and Apache Tomcat. You also have the option of
            running
            Oracle REST Data Services in standalone mode.</p>

        <p>To REST-expose database data with Oracle REST Data Services, you have the following options to choose
            from:
        </p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Automatic REST enabling (AutoREST) of database objects</li>
            <li>Manually creating RESTful services, using SQL and PL/SQL operations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The first option provides a quick way to define a RESTful service on a database object, such as a table
            or
            view, or a PL/SQL function, procedure, or entire package. With AutoREST, Oracle REST Data Services
            automatically maps HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on) to data operations allowed on a
            database
            object you want to REST-enable, thus automatically exposing it to HTTP.</p>

        <p>Creating a RESTful service using the second option, although a more time-consuming process, provides you
            with
            more flexibility and customizability. For example, it allows you to do extra validation and customize
            input
            or output data formats, explicitly specifying SQL or PL/SQL for each HTTP method you define for a
            specific
            resource template. Figure 1 gives a simplified depiction of how this architecture works:</p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 1: Making REST calls to Oracle Database with Python via Oracle REST
            Data
            Services.</p>

        <p>If you choose to implement the architecture shown in Figure 1, you&#39;ll need to create a resource
            module in
            Oracle REST Data Services, within which you can define a group of related resource templates (individual
            RESTful services)and implement a set of necessary HTTP method handlers for each resource template
            (RESTful
            service). A detailed example of how this can be accomplished will be provided in the next article of
            this
            series.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: For definitions of specific terms related to RESTful services, such as
            <em>resource
                template</em> and <em>method handler</em>, check the &quot;<a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56351_01/doc.30/e87809/developing-REST-applications.htm#AELIG90011">RESTful
                Services Terminology</a>&quot; section in the <a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56351_01/doc.30/e87809/toc.htm"><em>REST Data Services
                    Installation,
                    Configuration, and Development Guide</em></a>.
        </p>

        <p>In this article, you will see an example of a simpler alternative that uses the AutoREST feature. As
            mentioned, with AutoREST, Oracle REST Data Services automatically creates REST endpoints for a specified
            database object, mapping HTTP verbs to database transactions behind the scenes for you.</p>

        <h3>Required Software</h3>

        <p>Before moving on to the article&#39;s example, you will need to prepare your working environment. In
            particular, make sure you have access to the following software components in your system:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Oracle Database 12.2 (or newer)</li>
            <li>Oracle SQL Developer 4.2 (or newer)</li>
            <li>Oracle REST Data Services 3.0.9 (or newer)</li>
            <li>Python 3.6.x (or newer)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With the <a
                href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/databaseappdev-vm-161299.html">Database
                Virtual Box Appliance</a> for <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VM VirtualBox</a>, the
            above
            software stack can be installed on your machine extremely easily. The appliance comes with these
            components
            preinstalled, configured, and ready to run. The only component missing in the appliance is Python 3.6.
            You
            may install it as described in the &quot;Installing Python on Oracle Linux&quot; section later in this
            article, or you can use the Python installation you may already have in your system.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The Database Virtual Box Appliance discussed here is installed into <a
                href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/overview/index.html">Oracle VM
                VirtualBox</a>, which is available for a number of operating systems, including Microsoft Windows,
            macOS, Oracle Solaris, and a number of Linux platforms. For further details, check the <a
                href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html">Oracle VM
                VirtualBox downloads page</a>.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, the above Oracle software components can be downloaded from <a
                href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/index.html">Oracle Technology Network (OTN)</a> and then
            installed in your system. Another option is to take advantage of Oracle Database in a cloud, choosing
            one of
            the <a href="https://cloud.oracle.com/database">Oracle Database Cloud Services</a> that normally come
            preconfigured with Oracle REST Data Services.</p>

        <h3><a name="wizard"></a>Installing and Deploying Oracle REST Data Services</h3>

        <p>Oracle REST Data Services comes packed in a WAR file (<code>ords.war</code>) with both Oracle Database
            and
            Oracle SQL Developer. Or you can download the latest package from the <a
                href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/rest-data-services/downloads/index.html">Oracle
                REST Data Services Downloads page</a> on OTN. In any case, before you can make use of Oracle REST
            Data
            Services, you must install and deploy it.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose to download and install the latest package, make sure that your
            system
            meets the <a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/ords-17/AELIG/installing-REST-data-services.htm#AELIG7175">requirements</a>
            listed in the documentation for this release.</p>

        <p>Once you have the WAR file in your system, you can install and configure Oracle REST Data Services. This
            can
            be done using a command-line interface. The following command starts the simple installation that
            requires
            minimum user input:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
java -jar ords.war
      	</code>
      </pre>
        </div>

        <p>To perform an advanced installation, use the following command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
java -jar ords.war install advanced
      	</code>
      </pre>
        </div>

        <p>The entire installation process is described in detail in the &quot;<a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56351_01/doc.30/e87809/installing-REST-data-services.htm#AELIG7015">Installing
                Oracle REST Data Services</a>&quot; section of the <a

                    Installation, Configuration, and Development Guide</em></a>.</p>

        <p>However, the quickest way to install Oracle REST Data Services is with the help of Oracle SQL
            Developer&#39;s
            ORDS Installation Wizard, which can be invoked by selecting the <strong>Tools &gt; REST Data Services
                &gt;
                Install</strong> menu item in Oracle SQL Developer.</p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 2: The first screen of the ORDS Installation Wizard in Oracle SQL
            Developer.</p>

        <p>The entire installation process is described in detail in the &quot;<a

        <h3>Installing Python on Oracle Linux</h3>

        <p>The Database Virtual Box Appliance mentioned previously uses Oracle Linux as the operating system. So, if
            you
            chose this appliance for your working environment, you may want to install Python in the virtual machine
            built in Oracle VM VirtualBox from this appliance.</p>

        <p>The following steps will guide you through the process of installing Python from the source code on
            Oracle
            Linux. These same steps can also be used on CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora.</p>

        <p>1. You must have the GCC compiler in your system to build Python from the source code. You can download
            and
            install it with yum, as follows:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
# yum install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>2. Download a gzipped source tarball of the latest Python 3 release:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
# cd /usr/src
# wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tgz
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>3. Unpack the package:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
# tar xzf Python-3.6.4.tgz
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>4. Compile the source code and install Python:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
# cd Python-3.6.4
# ./configure --enable-optimizations
# make altinstall
     	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>The <code>altinstall</code> option is used to avoid overwriting the default Python executable used in
            your
            system.</p>

        <p>5. Locate the newly installed Python executable:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
#which python3.6
/usr/local/bin/python3.6
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>6. Launch the Python prompt to make sure it works:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
# python3.6
Python 3.6.4 (default, Dec 20 2017, 20:48:42) 
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-18)] on linux
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>Now that you have installed Python 3, you need to install, a Python HTTP library that simplifies working
            with
            HTTP requests, providing an easy-to-use interface to make REST calls from Python. You can use it as your
            primary tool when it comes to writing Python code that consumes RESTful services.</p>

        <p>There are several ways in which you can. The steps below describe how you can install Requests from the
            source code:</p>

        <p>1. Download the Requests library as the source code from GitHub, where it is actively developed:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
https://github.com/requests/requests/tarball/master
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>2. Unpack the downloaded gzipped source tarball in your system and run the cd command to change to the
            unpacked source directory.</p>

        <p>3. Install the request library using the <code>pip</code> command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
$ pip3.6 install .
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>4. After the installation completes, check to make sure it was successful:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
$ python3.6
...

&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt;
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>This completes the process of setting up your working environment. And now you are ready to proceed to
            create
            the article&#39;s sample.</p>

        <h3>Building a RESTful Service with Oracle REST Data Services</h3>

        <p>By following the instructions in this section, you will create a RESTful service upon a database table,
            using
            the AutoREST feature of Oracle REST Data Services. In particular, you will REST-expose the departments
            table
            from the HR sample schema that comes with Oracle Database.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: As mentioned earlier in this article, AutoREST provides a no-code solution for
            exposing database data to HTTP. And if you want more control, then you can roll your own resource
            modules.
            The latter option will be covered in detail in the third article of this series.</p>

        <p>Follow these steps to AutoREST-enable the hr.departments table with Oracle SQL Developer:</p>

        <p>1. In Oracle SQL Developer, move to the Connections pane and find the HR schema. If you do not see this
            schema there, you have to create a new connection for it:</p>

        <p>In the Connections pane, right-click the <strong>Connections</strong> node and select <strong>New
                Connection</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the New / Select Database Connection dialog box, enter the required information (if you are using the
            VM
            appliance, all passwords are set to <code>oracle</code>):</p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 3: Setting up a connection to the HR schema in Oracle SQL Developer.
        </p>

        <p>After filling in the dialog box&#39;s fields, click <strong>Test</strong> to test the newly created
            connection. If it is successful, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

        <p>2. In the Connections pane, find and expand the HR schema.</p>

        <p>3. Under HR schema node, expand <strong>Tables(Filtered)</strong>. Then, right-click
            <strong>DEPARTMENTS</strong> and select <strong>Enable REST Service</strong> from the pop-up menu to
            invoke
            the RESTful Services Wizard:
        </p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 4: Auto-enabling a database object with the RESTful Services Wizard in
            Oracle SQL Developer.</p>

        <p>4. On the first screen of the wizard, select the <strong>Enable object</strong> checkbox and deselect the
            <strong>Authorization required</strong> checkbox, as shown in the above figure.
        </p>

        <p>5. On the Summary screen of the wizard, view the summary information, and click <strong>Finish</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Before that, however, you can look at the PL/SQL code that will be executed behind the scenes when you
            click
            Finish. To see it, click the <strong>SQL</strong> tab in the Summary screen. You should see the
            following:
        </p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
DECLARE
  PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN

    ORDS.ENABLE_OBJECT(p_enabled =&gt; TRUE,
                       p_schema =&gt; &#39;HR&#39;,
                       p_object =&gt; &#39;DEPARTMENTS&#39;,
                       p_object_type =&gt; &#39;TABLE&#39;,
                       p_object_alias =&gt; &#39;departments&#39;,
                       p_auto_rest_auth =&gt; FALSE);
    
    commit;

END;
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>6. Finally, check to see if the Oracle REST Data Services process is running. You should see it in the
            Processes pane. If you do not see it there, run it using the ORDS Run Wizard, which can be launched by
            selecting the <strong>Tools &gt; REST Data Services &gt; Run</strong> menu item.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The ORDS Installation Wizard discussed in the &quot;<a href="#wizard">Installing
                and
                Deploying Oracle REST Data Services</a>&quot; section earlier has the Run Standalone Mode screen,
            where
            you can select the <strong>Run in Standalone Mode when installation completes</strong> checkbox. If you
            did
            so, Oracle REST Data Services should already be running. However, the next time you load your system,
            you
            need to explicitly run Oracle REST Data Services.</p>

        <p>That&#39;s it. A RESTful service upon the hr.departments database table is created and you are now ready
            to
            make an HTTP request to it, to make sure it works. The quickest way to test a RESTful service is with a
            web
            browser. So, point your browser to the following location:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
http://yourdbserver:9090/ords/hr/departments/
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>This assumes that 9090 is used as the HTTP port for Oracle REST Data Services to listen on in your
            system.
        </p>

        <p>Figure 5 shows what you should see as a result:</p>

        <p align="center" class="xsml">Figure 5: Using a web browser to quickly test the RESTful service.</p>

        <p>Figure 5 indicates that the RESTful service you created works as expected and you can now test it from
            your
            Python environment. Before moving on to Python, however, let&#39;s take a closer look at what just
            happened.
            Oracle REST Data Services received a GET request on /ords/hr/departments/ from the browser and issued
            the
            <code>SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS</code> query to the underlying database in response. The query result
            was
            then converted to JSON and sent back to the browser.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing Your RESTful Service in Python</h3>

        <p>In this simple test, you will make a GET HTTP request to the RESTful service you just created. Using the
            Request library, this can be done very easy:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(&#39;http://yourdbserver:9090/ords/hr/departments/&#39;)
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>Then, you can convert the result to JSON and output it to see exactly the same as what you saw in your
            browser before:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; jo = r.json()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(json.dumps(jo, indent=4))
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>

        <p>The output should be the following:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
      	<code>
{
    &quot;items&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;department_id&quot;: 10,
            &quot;department_name&quot;: &quot;Administration&quot;,
            &quot;manager_id&quot;: 200,
            &quot;location_id&quot;: 1700,
            &quot;links&quot;: [
                {
                    &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;self&quot;,
                    &quot;href&quot;: &quot;http://yourdbserver:9090/ords/hr/departments/10&quot;
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            &quot;department_id&quot;: 20,
            &quot;department_name&quot;: &quot;Marketing&quot;,
            &quot;manager_id&quot;: 201,
            &quot;location_id&quot;: 1800,
            &quot;links&quot;: [
                {
                    &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;self&quot;,
                    &quot;href&quot;: &quot;http://yourdbserver:9090/ords/hr/departments/20&quot;
                }
            ]
        },

...
      	</code>
  </pre>
        </div>
