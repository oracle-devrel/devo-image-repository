        <p><strong>&ldquo;My SQL is stuck.&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;My Query is taking long time to execute.&rdquo;.</strong></p>

        <p>These problem statements are very common, but for the most part the problems as easily solved&mdash;if you
            know how to debug the issue. In this article I will attempt to explain how I debugged and solved a real
            performance issue. (Note that the objects have been renamed.)</p>

        <p>I received a request to look into a performance issue: &ldquo;I am unable to refresh GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV
            materialized view, and the dbms_mview.refresh is stuck for last the 45 minutes.&rdquo; The person was trying
            to re-create GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV materialized view after adding one new varchar2 column from the existing
            base table. There was no other change in the query of the materialized view, no table was added, and no
            condition was altered. Prior to the problem this materialized view refreshed in less than 5 minutes.</p>

        <p>I performed the following steps to debug and resolve the performance issue. Step 1: I look into V$SESSION to
            see if the session is Waiting or Working. The person is logged in with the DBSNPUSR schema.</p>

       SID STATE               SECONDS_IN_WAIT EVENT                                                    SQL_ID

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Figure 1</strong></p>

        <p>The session STATE is &ldquo;WAITED SHORT TIME,&rdquo; which means the session is working. The EVENT is
            &ldquo;direct path write temp,&rdquo; which means the database is writing to a temporary tablespace.</p>

        <p>To explain V$SESSION a bit, we usually look at the STATE column first to check whether the session is Waiting
            for something or Working. The EVENT column tells us what the event Session is Waiting for, or what task
            Session is performing. SECONDS_IN_WAIT tells us how long our session has been waiting for something. In this
            case the database is writing (not waiting), so SECONDS_IN_WAIT is 0. If SECONDS_IN_WAIT has some significant
            number, there might be a performance bottleneck. SQLID is the identifier of the SQL statement associated
            with the operation the session is performing.</p>

        <p>Now we need to debug what the database is doing. The simplest way to know what operation the database is
            working on is to look into V$SESSION_LONGOPS.</p>

            <pre>
<code>
ngarg&gt; select target, time_remaining, elapsed_seconds, sql_plan_operation, sql_plan_options
  2  from v$session_longops where sql_id = &#39;70bybu7qaukzb&#39; and  TIME_REMAINING &gt; 0;

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Figure 2</strong></p>

        <p>OK, now we know that the database is full-scanning DBSNPUSR.GLUSR_OPTY_STG for the last 6238 seconds and that
            46383 seconds remain. At first sight, the GLUSR_OPTY_STG table seems to have some issues.</p>

        <p>Here is some detail about the V$SESSION_LONGOPS columns I used in my query. V$SESSION_LONGOPS displays the
            status of various operations that run for longer than six seconds.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>TARGET column identifies the object on which Oracle is performing the operation</li>
            <li>TIME_REMAINING provides the estimated time in which Oracle should complete the operation</li>
            <li>ELAPSED_SECONDS refers to the seconds elapsed since the operation started</li>
            <li>SQL_PLAN_OPERATION identifies which operation session is performing on the target</li>
            <li>SQL_PLAN_OPTIONS tells us how the session is performing SQL_PLAN_OPERATION on TARGET</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The query of GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV reveals that GLUSR_OPTY_STG is being used in &ldquo;WITH CLAUSE&rdquo;, and
            that the view &ldquo;base&rdquo; was used multiple times. (I can&rsquo;t share the complete code here, but
            that code is not significant to our performance issue.)</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 3</strong></p>

        <p>The natural next step is to look at the Execution Plan for Query of GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MVs. We can easily get
            the time Execution plan of any SQL (if we know the SQL_ID) using the dbms_xplan.display_cursor.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 4</strong></p>

        <p>The figure above I have trimmed the output and removed the extra data, so that we can focus on the issue
            (highlighted). As we can see in execution plan, GLUSR_OPTY_STG is used 4 times with &ldquo;MAT_VIEW ACCESS
            FULL&rdquo; access path, but the Oracle is expecting only 1 row from this it. This looks like some issue.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s check how many rows GLUSR_OPTY_STG table has-</strong></p>

        <p>With the two outputs above we can determine that the statistics for all the tables used in the query of the
            GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV materialized view are similar, except that the GLUSR_OPTY_STG. GLUSR_OPTY_STG
            statistics are missing/stale, as determined by which Oracle database is generating a suboptimal plan. Now
            that we have the action plan, we should gather the stats of GLUSR_OPTY_STG, and execute the refresh for the
            GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV materialized view.</p>

        <p>The produced output might look like this:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>

ngarg&gt; exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(null, &#39;GLUSR_OPTY_STG&#39;);      2
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Figure 9</strong></p>

        <p>Just to add a little about dbms_stats.gather_table_stats, it uses ESTIMATE_PERCENT to control the sample size
            used when gathering statistics and default values for ESTIMATE_PERCENT is AUTO_SAMPLE_SIZE, which means that
            the Oracle Database automatically determines the appropriate sampling percentage, which is highly
            recommended over the fixed sampling percentage.</p>

        <p>After I gathered the statistics, the GLUSR_OPTY_STG, GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV materialized view was refreshed in
            under 5 minutes. When I checked with the developer, he confirmed that before creating GLUSR_OPPORTUNITY_MV
            materialized view, he re-created GLUSR_OPTY_STG too.</p>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

        <p>To generate the optimal execution plan, Oracle database is very much dependent on statistics. Most
            performance issues can be resolved if we can ensure that table statistics are not missing and that the
            statistics are not stale. Also, use the default value of ESTIMATE_PERCENT, which is AUTO_SAMPLE_SIZE, so
            that Oracle can effectively gather statistics by adjusting the sample size when the data distribution
            changes. Happy Database Performance Tuning!</p>
