        <p>cx_Oracle is a Python extension module that enables querying and updating of Oracle databases using a <a
                href="//www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249">database API</a> that is common to all database access
            modules. A number of extensions to the common database API have also been included in order to take
            advantage of some of the features available exclusively to Oracle.</p>

        <p>cx_Oracle has been in development for more than ten years and has covered most of the requirements of those
            needing access to Oracle in Python. In December 2008, however, a major new release addressed a number of
            limitations in earlier versions and added support for Python 3.0 and some new features recently made
            available in Oracle. This article aims to cover the new features in depth and give reasons why you might
            want to use them in your code.</p>


        <h3>Support for Unicode and Python 3.0</h3>

        <p>In earlier versions of cx_Oracle, no help was given to those wishing to use Unicode strings in their code.
            Code would have to be written something like that shown in Listing 1.</p>

        <p><strong>Listing 1: Old-style Unicode handling in cx_Oracle 4.x</strong></p>
        <div class="ocode">

                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>
            <pre>
<code>import cx_Oracle 
import os 

os.environ["NLS_LANG"] = ".AL32UTF8" 

START_VALUE = u"Unicode \u3042 3" 
END_VALUE = u"Unicode \u3042 6" 

connection = cx_Oracle.Connection("cx_Oracle/dev@t11g") 
cursor = connection.cursor() 
cursor.execute(""" 
        select UnicodeCol 
        from TestUnicodes 
        where UnicodeCol &gt; :startValue 
          and UnicodeCol &lt; :endValue""", 
        startValue = START_VALUE.encode(connection.nencoding), 
        endValue = END_VALUE.encode(connection.nencoding)) 
for rawValue, in cursor: 
    actualValue = rawValue.decode(connection.nencoding) 
    print "Actual Value:", actualValue

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            Note that any time data was passed to Oracle Database, it would have to be encoded into the client character
            set; any time data was retrieved from the database it would have to be decoded from the client character
            set. Although clearly code could be written to handle Unicode strings properly, it was messy and prone to
            error. With the advent of Python 3.0, in which all strings are Unicode strings, cx_Oracle obviously needed
            to adapt. Just as clearly, the changes to the Python 3.x C API were significant enough to make introducing
            support for Python 3.x and Unicode strings at the same time difficult. For this reason, support for Unicode
            strings was first added to Python 2.x in a form of <em>Unicode mode</em>, and then support for Python 3.x
            was added later. </p>


        <p>In Unicode mode, all strings passed to Oracle are expected to be in Unicode, and all strings returned are
            also in Unicode. This not only includes bind variables and result sets from queries but also statement text,
            connection parameters, and attribute values, just as would take place in Python 3.x. Unicode mode is a
            compile time option that is disabled by default in Python 2.x but can be enabled by setting the environment
            variable WITH_UNICODE before building the module.</p>

        <p>Regardless of which mode is in use, all data represented by the national character set (NCLOB and NVARCHAR2
            columns, for example) is now returned in Unicode and expected to be bound in Unicode. This means that the
            code sample shown in Listing 1 can be simplified by removing all encoding and decoding operations. Listing 2
            demonstrates this.</p>

            </div>
            <pre>
<code>import cx_Oracle 

START_VALUE = u"Unicode \u3042 3" 
END_VALUE = u"Unicode \u3042 6"

cursor = connection.cursor() 
cursor.execute(""" 
        select UnicodeCol

        where UnicodeCol &gt; :startValue 
          and UnicodeCol &lt; :endValue""",

        endValue = END_VALUE) 
for actualValue, in cursor: 
    print "Actual Value:", actualValue 
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>When Unicode mode is not in use, though, all data represented in the database character set is still expected
            to be represented as Python strings, just as in cx_Oracle 4.x. Fortunately, the enhancement described next
            in this article explains how this can also be avoided if desired, without resorting to Unicode mode or
            upgrading to Python 3.x. </p>

        <h3>Input/Output Type Handlers</h3>

        <p>A second major feature of cx_Oracle 5.x is the introduction of input and output type handlers. With these in
            place, a great deal of flexibility and customizability is now possible. For example, if it was considered
            desirable to have all strings returned as Unicode, the code in Listing 3 could be used. <strong>Listing 3:
                How to return all strings as Unicode strings</strong></p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>
            <pre>
<code>import cx_Oracle 
 
def OutputTypeHandler(cursor, name, defaultType, size,
        precision, scale): 
    if defaultType in (cx_Oracle.STRING, cx_Oracle.FIXED_CHAR): 
        return cursor.var(unicode, size, cursor.arraysize) 

connection = cx_Oracle.Connection("cx_Oracle/dev@t11g") 
connection.outputtypehandler = OutputTypeHandler 
cursor = connection.cursor() 
cursor.execute(""" 
        select * 
        from TestStrings 
        where StringCol &gt; :startValue 
          and StringCol &lt; :endValue""", 
        startValue = u"String 3", 
        endValue = u"String 6") 
for row in cursor: 
    print "Row:", row 
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Input and output type handlers can be set at either the cursor level (where only that cursor is affected) or
            the connection level (all cursors created using that connection are affected unless they have their own
            input or output type handlers). A value of None for either the input or output type handler means that
            processing will take place using cx_Oracle’s default algorithms. </p>

        <p>An input type handler method is called whenever a bind variable needs to be created to pass data from Python
            into Oracle. The cursor, the value being bound, and the number of elements that need to be created are
            passed to the method. The return value is expected to be a variable object or None, meaning that default
            processing will take place. The variable object created should be able to bind the Python value. In order to
            help in this regard, variable objects can now be created with input converters. These methods are called
            with the Python value being bound and expect in return a Python value that cx_Oracle already knows how to
            bind directly. One final point: calling PL/SQL procedures and functions or anonymous PL/SQL blocks
            introduces the possibility of input/output or even output-only bind variables. These are still covered by
            input type handlers, even though data can be returned to Python from Oracle.</p>

        <p>An output type handler method is called whenever a bind variable needs to be created to return data to Python
            from Oracle after a query has been executed. In this case, the cursor; the name of the column being
            returned; the default variable type; and the size, precision, and scale of the column being returned are
            passed to the method. As with input type handlers, the return value is expected to be a variable object or
            None, meaning that default processing will take place. If further manipulation of the data returned to
            Python is desired, an output converter can be set on the variable. These methods are called with the value
            that would otherwise be returned to Python and return the value that will actually be returned to Python.
        </p>


        <p>A couple more examples should make clear how powerful this enhancement can be in controlling the interface
            between Python and Oracle. Listing 4 demonstrates how to bind an arbitrary object to a cursor. Listing 5
            demonstrates how to return numbers as decimal.Decimal objects or as strings in order to manage numbers that
            are much larger than floating precision numbers can handle.</p>

        <p>Suppose you need to upload a couple of binary large objects (BLOBs) to the database and save them to the
            blob_tab table that you might have created in a custom database schema, as follows:</p>

        <h3>Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP) Support</h3>

        <p>In Oracle Database 11<em>g</em> Release 1, Oracle introduced Database Resident Connection Pooling. Unlike
            session pooling, where connections are pooled in the client and are only effective within a single threaded
            process, DRCP pools connections on the server, enabling pooling across multiple client processes. This
            enhancement is particularly useful with Web servers such as Apache that are frequently set up to spawn a
            process for each hit. The performance increase gained and the resource requirements reduced by using DRCP in
            this situation can be quite dramatic. Support for this feature was added to PHP in 2008; with version 5,
            cx_Oracle adds support for this feature to Python as well.</p>

        <p>Once the DRCP pool has been started on the database and a tnsnames.ora entry augmented with SERVER=POOLED,
            use of this feature within Python is very straightforward. The only difference between creating a normal
            connection and creating a connection using DRCP is the use of the parameter cclass. This parameter is a
            string that specifies the connection class, a logical grouping of servers. Connections made using the same
            connection class may be shared, whereas connections made using different connection classes will never be
            shared. One other parameter available in the connection constructor that influences whether or not an
            existing connection in the pool can be used is the purity parameter. If this value is set to
            cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_SELF (which is also the default value), then existing sessions in the pool will be
            used if available. If this value is set to cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_NEW, however, then a new session will be
            created.</p>

        <p>Once a connection has been created, it can be used in exactly the same way as any other connection. When the
            connection is closed (or the connection object is garbage collected), the session is returned to the pool
            for possible reuse. Listing 6 shows a simple example of creating connections using DRCP.</p>

<code>import cx_Oracle 

o       connection = cx_Oracle.Connection("cx_Oracle/dev@t11g_drcp", 
        cclass = "TEST1.CLASS") 

connection2 = cx_Oracle.Connection("cx_Oracle/dev@t11g_drcp", 
        cclass = "TEST2.CLASS", 
        purity = cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_NEW) 
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Database Change Notification</h3>

        <p>Another feature of Oracle Database, initially introduced in Oracle Database 10<em>g</em> Release 2 and
            enhanced further in Oracle Database 11<em>g</em> Release 1, is Database Change Notification. This feature
            enables client applications to register queries with the database and receive notification of data
            manipulation language (DML) or data definition language (DDL) changes to the tables underlying those queries
            when the transaction making those changes is committed. Notification can be done via e-mail, HTTP URL PL/SQL
            procedure, or callback. cx_Oracle currently only supports the callback method but the other methods will be
            supported in future releases.</p>


        <p>In order to get started with database change notification, a subscription object must be created. This object
            describes the conditions under which notification takes place and the action to take when those conditions
            are met. A subscription object is created by calling the subscribe method on the connection. The parameters
            to this method control the behavior of the subscription and cannot be changed once the subscription has been
            created. Any number of subscription objects can be created, however, each with different characteristics.
            The values of these characteristics are available as read-only attributes on the created subscription object
            for convenience.</p>

        <p>The only parameter that is required for any useful work to be done is the callback parameter. It specifies a
            callable object that accepts a single argument: a message object that is generated during the callback and
            describes the event that triggered the notification (more on that later). All of the other parameters are
            optional, and their default values are reasonable for most uses.</p>

        <p>In order to filter the operations on which notifications will be sent, use the operations parameter which is
            constructed from a bitwise-include OR of flags from the table below. The following table describes the
            various options and their meanings. The values can be "or’ed" together in order to cover multiple operations
            at the same time.</p>

        <p>In order to reduce the amount of time during which notifications will be sent, use the timeout parameter. The
            default value of 0 means that notifications will be sent until the subscription object is deleted or goes
            out of scope. Any other value represents the number of seconds during which notifications will be sent. </p>

        <p>The final parameter that can have a meaningful value is called rowids and is a Boolean value specifying
            whether or not the rowids of the affected rows should be included in the notification messages that are
            sent. The other two parameters (namespace and protocol) are reserved for future expansion and should be left
            at their default values.</p>

        <p>Once a subscription object has been created, the final step is to register queries, each of which will result
            in notifications sent for each table underlying those queries that is changed. A single message is sent for
            each transaction that changes the registered tables. Queries are registered by calling the registerquery
            method, which behaves similarly to the execute method on a cursor. It accepts the SQL for the query and
            optionally a list of arguments. In the current version, the arguments have no bearing on the messages that
            are sent. In a future version, cx_Oracle will add support for query change notification (available in Oracle
            Database 11<em>g</em> Release 1) and then the arguments can be important.</p>

        <p>Once queries have been registered on the subscription object, callbacks will take place every time one of the
            requested operations takes place on a registered table. This takes place in a separate thread, so care
            should be taken to avoid using the same connection in two threads at the same time. The message object that
            is passed to the callback has three attributes describing the event that took place. The first is called
            dbname and gives the name of the database that generated the notification. The second is type and describes
            the type of event that took place, but its value in this version is always the same:
            cx_Oracle.EVENT_OBJCHANGE. The third parameter is called tables and is a list of message table objects.</p>

        <p>Message table objects have these attributes: name (the name of the table affected), operation (the operation
            that took place on the table), and rows. The rows attribute is a list of message row objects if the value of
            the rowids parameter when creating the subscription object was true. The message row object has two
            attributes: operation (the operation that took place on that row) and rowid (contains the rowid of the row
            that was affected).</p>

        <p>Listing 7 is an example of how to use database change notification in cx_Oracle. Once the code is running,
            insert, update, or delete rows in the table cx_Oracle.TestExecuteMany to see the notifications taking place.
