        <p><a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript is a programming language</a> used to create and control
            dynamic website content. (i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or changes on-screen without reloading a web
            page).</p>

        <p>JavaScript features:</p>

        <h2>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers</h2>

        <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the backbone of web development. HTML creates the structure of a web page. CSS
            controls how that page looks, and JavaScript makes the page dynamic or interactive.</p>

        <p>JavaScript can control website automation. The script tells the website what to do. This can include telling
            images to animate themselves or photos to cycle like a slide show. JavaScript can also suggest a form to
            autocomplete its blanks based on prompts.</p>

        <p>All major browsers come with the ability to render JavaScript. This means JS commands get placed in an HTML
            document that the browser can read. It can be instantly used without any extra software.</p>

        JavaScript is also in apps for mobile devices. Another use is to create interactivity for browser-based games.

        <h2>Adding JavaScript to Website</h2>

        <p>JavaScript can be embedded into a web page or included in a .js file. JavaScript is a client-side language,
            not a server-side program. It's downloaded to the user's computer and then processed.</p>

        <p>To add the code to your web page, you use the &quot;script&quot;tag and give it the type attribute
            &quot;text/javascript&quot;.</p>

        <p>Here is a sample:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;JavaScript goes here. &lt;/sript&gt;
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>This program is then downloaded into the site-visitor's computer and run. The only caveat is if they have
            turned off their browser's ability to run JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>What are JavaScript Objects</h2>

        <p>An object is a set of properties and methods. A property can be anything from a string or a number, to an
            image or another object. Properties are accessed with the dot operator notation (eg.,
            myObjectObject.property ) and methods are called with a function call syntax
            (myObjectObject.&lt;methodToCall&gt;() ).</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-objects-prototypes">Javascript objects</a> are unique
            in that they are values. This is unlike other languages where objects are a reference type.</p>

        <p>Object properties and methods use dot notation or brackets. An object passes by reference from one function
            to another. It can also include another object as a property.</p>

        <p>A JavaScript object is a standalone entity. It holds many property and method values. The object property
            stores a literal value and the method represent a function. Creating an object can be done using object
            literal or object constructor syntax.

        <h2>JavaScript Array</h2>
        <p>Javascript arrays and objects are similar, but not the same. Objects are a specialized array. Arrays, no

        <p>An array is an ordered sequence of values. They can hold many related items. This makes them ideal for
            storing lists of form inputs such as online shopping cart products.</p>

        <p>Objects designed to hold strings or numbers as properties will do so no matter what your index is on them.

var myObject = {a:1,b:"This is a string",c:[1,"Another String"]},
     myArray = ["something", 1.2, "and an array"];
     console.log(myArray);
     //outputs ["something", 1.2, "and an array"].
If I put in "myObject" as the array, it will output ["something", 1.2]

        <h2>Why do Arrays Work as Objects in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>The obvious question to consider is why arrays work as objects in JavaScript. This odd behavior is the result
            of how browsers handle
            objects, and it's a good thing.</p>
        <p>Once a browser handles an object like an array, for example, that object belongs to the browser. That means
            you can access the object from another file in your program when using the same browser. You'll have access
            to whatever methods and properties belong to that object.</p>

        <p>Let's look at it from another perspective.</p>

        <p>Arrays work as Javascript objects because arrays are JavaScript objects. Other files can access any array
            using the same browser. In essence, when you create a new array, you're creating an object defined by type
            'Array'.</p>

        <p>This means that the array you created is not one big list of numbers or strings. Instead, it's an object with
            its own methods and properties.</p>

        <p>If you access your newly-created array as a normal object, it will have its own methods and properties. These
            properties are the same ones you defined when you created the array. Methods on this new object can get or
            set values in the array.</p>

        <p>Developers don't need to worry about creating objects that belong to a browser. JavaScript informs the
            browser how to handle objects. This process adds instructions between your code and the underlying object
            technology.</p>

        <p>At first glance, arrays as JavaScript objects might seem odd. It shines when developers use other files to
            manipulate array properties and methods.

        <h2>Why is JavaScript Called a Scripting Language?</h2>
        <p>A programming language is a formal language with rules. The language specifies a set of instructions that can
            produce various outputs. These outputs include things like the display of text on monitors, printers, or web
            pages.</p>

        <p>Programming languages can also control machine actions. This includes music playback, cameras, and any other
            action performed by computers. The system interprets the script to perform an action. Scripting languages
            are dynamically typed with little or no compile time.

        <h2>JavaScript History</h2>
        <p>Rumors suggested JavaScript got its name because it resembles Java. But it was actually developed by Brendan
            Eich before there was a Java language. Mocha was the first form of JavaScript that debuted in May 1995.

        <p>The name changed to LiveScript early in 1996. Then it changed to JavaScript with the release of Netscape
            Navigator 2.0 in December of that same year.</p>

        <p>A common myth says the term "Java" came from the word "Java" in the coffee industry and that Java is a type
            of coffee. But Java was actually named after the <a href="https://github.com/trending/javascript">Indonesian
                island of Java</a> where its creator lived.</p>

        <p>It's believed that Netscape used JavaScript as an internal programming language. The idea was to use it for
            their web browser so they could enhance it without having to learn C++.</p>

        <p>When the language went public in 1995, it did not get much attention. But attention exploded once Internet
            Explorer began supporting it in version 3.

            includes the ability to resize images to fit within a website.</p>

        <p>With a simple click of a button, the user can display certain information. They can click on a menu label
            that reveals a pulldown menu for their selection.</p>

        <p>Users can even zoom in and out of images for a better view.</p>

        <p>To simplify complex info, JavaScript can create tabs on a website for easy perusal of content. There is also
            a great benefit for users in the added ability to play animations, audio, and video.</p>
