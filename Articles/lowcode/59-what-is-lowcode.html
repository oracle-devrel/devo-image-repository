        <p>Any novice that's tried their hand at coding knows how complex the process can be. Thanks to Low Code
            programs, you don't need a degree in computer science to build an application. At its surface, <a
                href="https://apex.oracle.com/en/platform/low-code">Low Code technology</a> uses drag-and-drop tools
            rather than complicated coding languages to facilitate the development and delivery of applications. Not
            only is it a simpler alternative to coding, but it also gets the job done faster. Here's a closer look at
            how Low Code platforms work. </p>

        <h2>What Is a Low Code Platform? </h2>

        <p>A Low Code stage uses a simplified interface that lets developers build applications and software that is
            both user-friendly and responsive. Rather than writing several lines of complex code and language structure,
            you can quickly and easily utilize Low Code to construct total applications with user interfaces,
            combinations and information.</p>
        <p>Low Code can be integrated with most systems, with the exception of extremely sophisticated systems that
            feature several backends and external data sources. Although Low Code requires some inherent knowledge about
            coding and software development, it can be practiced by non-professionals. Here are some of the features
            that can be found in a Low Code platform:

        </p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>
                <h4>Drag-and-Drop Interfaces</h4>
                At its core, Low Code platforms rely on drag-and-drop interfaces to encourage the development of
                projects. This convenient tool lets users select the feature they want and simply drag it into their
                project.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Visual Integrated Development Environment</h4>
                A visual integrated development environment (IDE) lets you characterize the user interfaces, work
                processes and information models of your application. You can also add manually written code where it is
                needed. The visual modeling tools offered by Low Code platforms can be read by anyone, including
                professional and non-professional developers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Heightened Functionality</h4>
                In regular or heavy coding, the coder has to build core modules from scratch to help guide applications.
                To quicken the process, Low Code systems simply provide these modules for you. For instance, you can use
                a service management module for a customer-facing app. Low Code systems also automatically handle
                information constructions, stockpiling and recovery.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Multiple Uses</h4>
                The ability to use pre-configured modules to facilitate application building offers more than just added
                convenience. Because these modules offer core functions that can be implemented across a variety of
                application types, Low Code platforms let you reuse technology as needed. They also come with
                multi-device compatibility, which allows you to utilize the same applications across different
                platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Application Lifecycle Manager</h4>
                This automated apparatus assists with the building, inspecting, and organizing of applications. It
                defines the parameters of a product, develops the product, and then conducts a test to assure the
                quality before deploying it. The application lifecycle manager also maintains and enhances the product
                over time.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Adaptability</h4>
                Low Code platforms are scalable, which means they can grow with you. For instance, if you are developing
                an application for your business and have a sudden surge in employees, you don't have to worry about
                your technology falling behind—Low Code platforms let you accommodate the increase.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Security</h4>
                Cyber-security is a serious issue in the United States—in just the first six months of 2020, 36 billion
                records were exposed. It's important that your Low Code platform comes with security features that
                protect your application and prevent it from being compromised.
            </li>

        <h2>Low Code Versus No-Code</h2>

        <p>Many software novices mistakenly use "Low Code" and "no-code" interchangeably. While some Low Code platforms
            can be highly restricted (depending on the types of features you use), they're still fundamentally different
            from no-code platforms.
            Both Low Code and no-code use drag-and-drop and visual features to make the coding process easier and
            quicker. However, no-code is not designed for user-friendly or responsive interfaces. Thus, no-code should
            only be used when developing extremely simple applications that require minimal customization and coding
            knowledge.

        <h2>Disadvantages of Low Code</h2>
        <p>Along with the pros, it's important to consider the cons of Low Code. Here are some disadvantages of using
            this type of technology.
        </p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>
                <h4>Simplicity</h4>
                What functions as an advantage simultaneously serves as a disadvantage. Low Code platforms are not as
                complex as heavy coding, which makes their functions more restricted. Low Code typically has lower
                levels of flexibility, customization and security. They're also better suited for customer-facing apps
                than entrepreneur apps, or apps designed for organizations rather than individuals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Expertise Requirements</h4>
                Although Low Code platforms are designed to facilitate application development for non-experts, it still
                requires a certain level of knowledge to navigate. In other words, Low Code platforms cannot be used by
                just anyone—you need to have a fundamental level of developmental expertise to succeed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Limited Integration</h4>
                Although Low Code can be integrated with a vast expanse of systems, it is not compatible with more
                complex or sophisticated software. These include ones that utilize external databases or multiple
                backends.
