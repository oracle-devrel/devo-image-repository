        <h2>Node.js: The basics</h2>

        <p>So what is Node.js? Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform <a
                href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/">JavaScript runtime environment</a> with a focus on server-side and
            networking applications.</p>

        <p>Node.js allows developers to build fast, scalable network applications using easy-to-understand code. It runs
            on Windows OS, Mac OSX, Linux, Unix, and other operating systems. It has support for <a
                href="https://developer.oracle.com/arm/">ARM processors</a>, like Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.</p>

        <p>The idea behind Node was conceived in early 2009 by Ryan Dahl. He had previously developed Web Machine. That
            was the first web application framework written in Google’s Chrome browser.</p>

        <p>The project started as a simple experiment. Still, it gained momentum among engineers looking for ways to
            write high-performance programs. This was without dealing with the complexities of traditional languages.

        <h2>A Deeper Social History with Node</h2>

        <p>Node was introduced to the public in December 2009 with a blog post that explained its advantages and
            challenges. The project gained recognition from industry giants such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle.
            It has since been contributing code back to Node’s open-source repository on GitHub nodejs.</p>

        <p>In 2013, when JavaScript became the most popular language among developers, according to one survey
            (Forrester research), Node had become an integral part of web development environments across various
            industries, including finance, education, and manufacturing, thanks in large part to its scalability and
            high-performance capabilities.</p>

        <p>Currently, over 300 contributors are working on Node.js. It is also supported by leading cloud providers like
            Amazon Web Services and Heroku. Thus, allowing you to easily deploy your applications onto these platforms
            for a low cost.</p>

        <p>Node is optimized for real-time web applications. Thus, giving it an edge over other languages and
            frameworks. Some frameworks can't perform well when handling concurrent connections. This is also true for
            heavy loads or I/O intensive tasks such as file processing.</p>

        <p>Industry experts like Douglas Crockford have highly praised Node. He is the author of JavaScript: The Good
            Parts.</p>

        <p>It had substantially contributed to the popularity of functional reactive programming. This allows developers
            to use asynchronous callbacks in their code. Whereas, usually, they would be dealing with threads.</p>

        <h2>Who Should Use Node.js?</h2>

        <p>Node.js is an ideal choice for developers that need to build fast, scalable network applications using easy
            code. They can build web servers and other backend systems such as those powering mobile apps or websites.

        <p>Node has a strong community of contributors working on it and some big-name supporters. This includes the
            likes of Microsoft, who have open-sourced their JavaScript engine ChakraCore.

        <p>Node’s core library (a decentralized key-value store) is written in C++, though not entirely. Linux
            Foundation’s CoreOS team contributed parts of its flagship project Tectonic to Node. Tectonic is a platform
            designed exclusively for running containers.</p>

        <p>In addition, there are <a
                href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/quickstartnodeonprem.html">lots of
                tutorials</a> available online that can help you get started coding your own server-side application
            within minutes without having to worry about managing a backend. Node.js cross-platform development is also
            available. </p>
        <p>Node makes it easy to run Node.js JavaScript on the server-side. It is not limited to just desktop or mobile
            applications.</p>

        <p>There are many tools that one can use with Node which allow you to use your existing HTML, CSS and JS
            skillset. This is used for building powerful web applications without having to learn a new programming
            language.</p>

        For JavaScript developers who are interested in Node.js specifically, Oracle offers many resources. <a

        <h2>Examples of Node.js Use</h2>

        <p>One can use Node.js for chat applications, web apps, games, and other real-time applications. For instance:
        </p>

        <p>BitPay, a Bitcoin payment processor, uses Node for instantaneous transactions by updating the amount in
            bitcoins to be sent as soon as their value fluctuates.</p>

        <p>Yahoo Weather Widget with weather updates from around the world is delivered straight to your desktop or
            mobile device without having to refresh your page.</p>

        <p>Tictac is an open-source multiplayer game where each player has just one finger on an iPhone, which can
            simultaneously control two tanks on both sides of a divided battlefield using various gestures such as
            tapping or swiping.</p>

        <p>You can either play against another user via Bluetooth (which doesn't require any internet connection) or
            participate in an online tournament with up to 16 players battling it out in real-time.</p>

        <p>Node-RED is a graphical tool that lets you create flows (or expressions such) of nodes that can be configured
            to perform specific tasks as collecting data from sensors, controlling your home thermostat and other
            devices, or even chain together multiple gadgets like the Philips Hue light bulb. Hence, it changes color
            based on weather conditions outside.</p>

        <p>Node.js is well suited to use in:</p>
        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Single page web application with Node.js development</li>
            <li>Web server back-end</li>
            <li>Mobile and desktop applications (including games)</li>
            <li>Back end for machine learning systems or IoT devices</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using Raspberry Pi, you can use a high-performance JavaScript engine on the device without having to have it
            connected to the internet 24 hours a day continuously since all data processing will happen locally on your
            computer, tablet, or phone that you are using at any given time.
        </p>

        <h2>Is Node.js A Programming Language?</h2>
        <p>No, it is not. Node.js was written in JavaScript. It provides a runtime environment for JavaScript to code
            server-side while using Google's V0 library.</p>

        <p>The library handles the heavy lifting part such as event handling, networking, etc. Node uses an asynchronous
            I/O model that makes its operations fast since they can happen without being blocked by other tasks.</p>

        <p>This means that developers don't have to worry about threads or locks when performing concurrent tasks on
            their system. With Node, this all happens automatically under the hood. Hence, you need to focus on writing
            your code and nothing else!</p>

        <p>When JS became a common language, Node had established as essential to development environments. This was all
            across various industries, including finance, education, and manufacturing. Thanks in large part to its
            scalability and high-performance capabilities.

        <h2>Is Node.js Front Or Backend?</h2>
        <p>Node.js is a backend technology as it allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side of their
            applications. One can use it for tasks such as collecting data from sensors, <a
                href="https://www.explainthatstuff.com/thermostats.html">controlling your home thermostat</a>.</p>


        <p>However, Node also offers modules and packages specifically made for front-end development. This is where you
            would create single-page web applications using frameworks such as AngularJS.</p>


        <p>Therefore, the node has an intentional lack of features. This is to focus more resources on its core
            libraries.This means there won't be any support for object-oriented programming. Specifically when
            developing with node (unless by implementing an external library).</p>


        <p>This does allow the node's codebase to remain small and efficient. This is great for developing applications
            that need to be ultra-fast.</p>


        <p>Node's <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=concepts-asynchronous-io">asynchronous I/O model</a>
            also serves as a bonus when using it on the front end since this means there won't be any blocking
            operations. You can focus only on writing your code without worrying about threads or locking.</p>


        <p>Ironically, Node itself does not have an event-driven architecture as programming languages do. It rather
            focuses more of its resources on providing developers with a way of scaling their web applications. This is
            done by creating many processes at once (for example, Apache server).</p>


        <p>This makes the node easy to use compared to other solutions such as CouchDB. This is because each request has
            to wait until the previous one finishes. This is done before processing it.

        <h2>Node Made Easy?</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, Node.js is a backend technology or server-side application that you can use to run JavaScript
            code. It has many benefits, such as being scalable and fast when using on the front end of your
            applications.</p>

        <p>It also doesn't require any object-oriented programming. Thus, making it easy to enter into coding in general
            since you'll only have one language at your disposal.</p>
