        <p>The dominant cloud topic in 2017 was serverless architectures. At the Devoxx conference in Belgium, one of
            the most prestigious developer conferences in Europe, you could attend at least seven different
            presentations about "serverless."</p>

        <p>This article introduces the Fn Project as a major new step in the serverless landscape. It’s different from
            most other solutions: Fn is a cloud-agnostic, polyglot, open source framework for serverless computing with
            Docker as the only dependency. It is also brand new; Fn was open sourced at the Java One 2017 conference.
        </p>

        <p>This article has several objectives. First, to lay the foundation and give you, as a developer, a quick
            introduction into the serverless world by demonstrating its unique advantages and by clarifying some
            not-so-well-defined terms. Second, and most importantly, to show how to quickly get started coding with the
            new Fn Project. For hands-on development we cover Go and Java, monitoring, testing, local development, JSON
            parameter marshalling, using Docker hub and running Fn in the cloud. Finally, the article provides an
            overview of recent announcements and what to expect next. Fn is just the beginning of a journey into the
            serverless world.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Serverless is obviously not a very good name. Let’s face it: the IT industry is pretty bad at proper naming
            and delivering exact definitions of new concepts. Cloud computing doesn’t happen in the sky. Data lakes
            aren’t wet. Serverless indeed involves real servers. So let’s better define “serverless” and some related
            concepts before we start coding.</p>

        <h3>Function as a Service (FaaS)</h3>

        <p>Function as a Service (FaaS) as a cloud service started in 2014 with AWS Lambda. The idea of FaaS is simple:
            you run your source code, but don’t need to care about the underlying language runtime, container, virtual
            machine, or server. In the easiest scenario, you just copy your source code, paste into a web frame of the
            FaaS cloud service, and run it.</p>

        <p>Technically, cloud-based FaaS solutions are implemented on top of containers (similar to, but not necessarily
            built with, Docker). However, this container is usually not exposed to the end user. The function is run
            only when it’s triggered by an event; this is why it is also called ephemeral compute. With FaaS, there is
            no server constantly running for a user. There is also no runtime permanently listening on an IP address and
            open port.</p>

        <p>Events that can trigger a function depend on the cloud provider. Common examples of event sources are: a file
            upload, a REST request or a message consumed from a messaging system.</p>

        <p>What makes FaaS interesting on public clouds is that you pay only for the invocation of the function. Also,
            the scaling is automated—i.e., there is no configuration for the number of function instances required.</p>

        <p>This "never pay for idle" concept is compelling. Several use cases report cost savings of one or two orders
            of magnitude when replacing a traditional, server-based application [1,2].</p>

        <p>Let’s be fair and also have a look at the drawbacks. The main concern with today’s FaaS implementations is
            vendor lock-in:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>The function itself is triggered by a typed, cloud-provider-specific event.</li>
            <li>The wiring between various event sources and functions often creates a hard coupling between your
                function and the services of a specific public cloud provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The concept of FaaS is still evolving, and there is a discussion amongst architects whether functions
            shouldn’t better be treated as containers [3]. Currently, none of the bigger public cloud providers expose
            the underlying container of a function.</p>

        <h3>Microservices vs FaaS</h3>

        <p>A microservices architecture tries to implement an application as a set of independent services. Each service
            runs in its own process and owns its data; the services communicate with a light-weight protocol [4]. When
            FaaS and microservices were both new, there was discussion about whether FaaS is just an implementation of
            microservices.</p>

        <p>In short: FaaS fulfils the definition of microservices. However, since a FaaS implements only a single
            function, several functions must be composed into a meaningful microservice. But how?</p>

        <h3>Serverless Cloud Architectures</h3>

        <p>Now that we have explained FaaS, let’s have a look at the difference between "serverless" and FaaS.</p>

        <p>Serverless is an architectural trend that tries to "reduce all notion of infrastructure" [5]. So FaaS is
            serverless. A serverless cloud service is a PaaS service with real pay per use and automated scalability.
        </p>

        <p>For an example of a serverless cloud service let’s picture a messaging service. If you pay only for the
            number of messages that you produce and consume, and if the service scales automatically, it’s fair to call
            it serverless.</p>

        <p>If servers are visible, with message brokers deployed to them, and you pay per hour provisioned if you
            produce or consume messages or not, then it is not serverless.</p>

        <h3>FaaS (Frameworks)</h3>

        <p>Currently, more than a dozen FaaS frameworks or platforms are available. (For an overview of the projects see
            [6].) These projects can be classified into three different categories, based on their objective and reach
            (where each category typically includes the characteristics of the previous one) [7]:</p>

        <p>1.Complexity: Reduce the complexity of a particular vendor’s cloud-based FaaS implementation—e.g., the
            configuration of the API gateway and access management that is required for a REST- based function. A
            typical example for this category: AWS Chalice.<br />
            2. Portability: Provide an abstraction framework for portability and ease of use on top of the FaaS
            implementation of various public cloud providers. A popular example is the serverless.com framework.<br />
            3. Standards: Provide a standard-based, serverless platform or framework to abstract running functions from
            the operation of servers. These frameworks are typically developed without a particular cloud provider in
            mind. When running such a framework on top of IaaS, servers are abstracted away, automated scaling is
            possible, but no true per invocation is achieved due to the IaaS pricing model. Examples for this category
            are Open FaaS, and Fn Project.</p>

        <h3>Fn Project</h3>

        <p>Fn Project is a serverless platform with a number of unique advantages: Fn is container-centric, polyglot,
            cloud agnostic and has Docker as the only dependency. At the moment, Fn project is a software platform and
            no FaaS as PaaS is available.</p>

        <p>It’s easiest to understand all these features when seeing Fn in action and running some functions yourself.
            So let’s get started with the installation first, and then do some coding.</p>

        <h3>Fn Project Installation</h3>

        <p>Fn installs easily on Windows and Unix systems with a one-line command.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install 
| sh
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>On Mac OS it can be installed with brew. For more details regarding the installation details see [8].On Mac
            OS it can be installed with brew. For more details regarding the installation details see [8].</p>

        <h3>Some Fn Basics with Go</h3>

        <p>To get your head around the Fn features I explained above, let’s start with a simple Go function. We create a
            new directory. In the new directory, we initialize a local Fn function using the Go language:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# create oradev and with boilerplate for go

$ fn init --runtime go oradev 
$ cd oradev</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Then you can immediately run the function with the run command and observe the output of our HelloWorld
            application. It will look as follows:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ fn run

Building image oradev:0.0.1 ..
{"message":"Hello World"}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>To see why this was possible, have a look at the generated files. There is a func.yaml configuration file
            generated that specifies a version number and the Go runtime. Also, a default go routine (func.go) is
            generated for you with a test data file test.json. <code>$ tree</code></p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
.
├── func.go
├── func.yaml
└── test.json
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you carefully check the output above when running the function, you’ll spot that a Docker image
            oradev:0.0.1 was built.</p>

        <p>The <code>fn run</code> command invokes the function directly. To create an endpoint for the function, we
            first need to start the Fn server in another terminal.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ fn start</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Once the server is running, you can deploy the function with the following command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ fn deploy --app mygo –-local

Deploying oradev to app: mygo at path: /oradev
Bumped to version 0.0.2
Building image oradev:0.0.2 ..
Updating route /oradev using image oradev:0.0.2...
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The function name is taken from the folder name. Alternatively, you can specify it in the func.yaml file.</p>

        <p>While deploying the function, the version of the Docker image is bumped to 0.0.2. Due to the deploy command,
            a new application is registered. An endpoint for the function is also created. To verify this, run the
            following two Fn commands that list the applications and the new route:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# check deployed applications
$ fn apps list
mygo

# check existing routes
$ fn routes list mygo

path	image		endpoint
/oradev	oradev:0.0.2	localhost:8080/r/mygo/oradev
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The function is registered now with Fn server, which acts like a micro API gateway. It accepts calls to the
            endpoint that we listed above and calls the deployed function. To try this yourself, run the following
            command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ # invoke function via fn server
$ fn call mygo /oradev

{"message":"Hello World"}
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Alternatively, since Fn servers provide a URL for the function, you can also invoke it with a simple curl
            command from the UNIX command line:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ # invoke function with UNIX curl
$ curl localhost:8080/r/mygo/oradev
{"message":"Hello World"}
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Yet another alternative is running the Docker image directly. Let’s try and run the generated Docker image
            with the following command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ # run the docker image
$ docker run oradev:0.0.2
{"message":"Hello World"}
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>All three approaches yield identical results.</p>

        <h3>Container / Function Duality</h3>

        <p>Note that invoking the function via its URL endpoint or running the Docker container returns exactly the same
            result! However, the Docker image that contains the function was built automatically, without any additional
            configuration or command necessary. So to speak Fn Project gives you Docker for free.</p>

        <p>Two of the many benefits of using Docker are:</p>

        <ul class="obullets" <li>You can run Docker images in any public cloud</li>
            <li>The Docker hub can store Docker images, which implies that the Docker hub can store your functions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will explore both concepts below. With Fn you simply write a function without paying attention to Docker,
            yet benefit from it by running your function as a container.</p>

        <h3>Fn Monitoring</h3>

        <p>Fn Project also comes with a basic monitoring tool that can be run as a Docker container with the following
            command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ docker run --rm -it --link fnserver:api -p 4000:4000 -e "FN_API_URL=http://api:8080" fnproject/ui

> FunctionsUI@0.0.21 start /app
> node server

Using API url: api:8080
Server running on port 4000
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>To access the console, open a browser and connect to port 4000. Run the Go function a couple of times more to
            see a change in the graphs of the monitoring console [9].</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Graph changes as viewed in monitoring console"
                src="https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/serverless-fn-project-figure1.jpg" style="width: 720px;" /></p>
        <p align="center" class="xsml">Graph changes as viewed in monitoring console</p>

        <h3>Prometheus Monitoring</h3>

        <p>For a more sophisticated monitoring solution, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Prometheus with CNCF
            Grafana is a good option. Fn exports metrics that allow monitoring with Prometheus without any additional
            configuration.</p>

        <p>Even without installing Prometheus, you can have a look at the metrics that are exported for Prometheus with
            the /metrics URL:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ curl localhost:8080/metrics | head

# HELP fn_api_completed Completed requests by path
# TYPE fn_api_completed counter
fn_api_completed{app="mygo",path="/oradev"} 11
# HELP fn_api_queued Queued requests by path
# TYPE fn_api_queued gauge
fn_api_queued{app="mygo",path="/oradev"} 0
# HELP fn_api_running Running requests by path
# TYPE fn_api_running gauge
fn_api_running{app="mygo",path="/oradev"} 0
# HELP fn_docker_stats_cpu_kernel docker_stats metric cpu_kernel
...
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Further details regarding Prometheus and Fn are described in [10].</p>

        <h3>Java HelloWorld Example</h3>

        <p>You could create a Java HelloWorld example the same way as we did the Go example just by replacing the
            runtime switch with Java:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ cd ~ && mkdir javatest && cd javatest
$ fn init --runtime java
Runtime: java
Function boilerplate generated.
func.yaml created.
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Java 9 is the default Java version. Note that for a Java project a Maven pom.xml file and a unit test
            HelloFunctionTest.java are also generated.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ tree 

.
├── func.yaml
├── pom.xml
└── src
    ├── main
    │   └── java
    │       └── com
    │           └── example
    │               └── fn
    │                   └── HelloFunction.java
    └── test
        └── java
            └── com
                └── example
                    └── fn
                        └── HelloFunctionTest.java
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Java JSON Parameter Marshalling and Function Logic</h3>

        <p>To show some more advanced features of Fn we skip the Java HelloWorld example and look at a mock example for
            a recommendation engine instead. You can clone it from github with the following command:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ git clone https://github.com/fmunz/fn-recommend.git
$ cd fn-recommend
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Have a look at the API of the function that simulates the recommendation logic. It uses a POJO as an input
            parameter that defines the traveller’s age, destination, and the month of travel:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# check the API of the handler function
$ grep handle src/main/java/com/munzandmore/fn/RecommendFunction.java 

    public String handleRequest(Traveller t) {

# examine the Traveller POJO
$ cat src/main/java/com/munzandmore/fn/Traveller.java 

package com.munzandmore.fn;
public class Traveller {
    public Integer age ;
    public String  destination ;
    public String  month;
}
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>This time we also want to push it automatically to Docker hub (unlike with the previous Go example, which we
            kept local). Therefore, we set the environment variable <code>FN_REGISTRY</code> to the
            <code>DOCKER_ID</code> and we also log into Docker hub. In the example below, replace <code>DOCKER_ID</code>
            with your own Docker login.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# set environment for Docker hub
$ export FN_REGISTRY=YOUR_DOCKER_ID
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: DOCKER_ID
Password: 
Login Succeeded
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Then deploy the function. We use the function for an Adventure Travel application, hence the name:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ fn deploy --app advtravel

        <p>From the output above you can tell that a Docker image is created and pushed to the Docker hub under
            <code>DOCKER_ID/fn-recommend:0.0.2.</code></p>

        <p>Again, you can check for the new application and the new route created within Fn server:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ fn apps list 
advtravel
mygo


$ fn routes list advtravel
path		image			endpoint
/fn-recommend	DOCKER_ID/fn-recommend:0.0.2  localhost:8080/r/advtravel/fn-recommend

</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>

You can run the function with a POST request with the curl command by providing the necessary JSON data structure for the request. As default, Fn uses the Jackson Java framework to automatically marshall the JSON input parameter to the correct Java type, but you can also use any marshalling framework for JSON or other formats like XML, etc.

$ cat testdata/muc.json
{
    "age": 41,
    "destination": "Munich",
    "month": "Oct"
}
# get a recommendation for Munich in October
$ curl -X POST --data @testdata/syd.json localhost:8080/r/advtravel/fn-recommend 

Visit the Octoberfest!
# there is more test data under testdata/Casablanca.json   
# see what is recommended for that city!
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>For evaluating different input parameters, a graphical tool such as Postman is more convenient. Check what
            the Fn-based mock recommends for a trip to Sydney:</p>

        <p>The output should look as follows:</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Figure 3. Example of Fn-based mock output"

        <h3>Fn in Public Clouds (IaaS)</h3>

        <p>A common question is how to use Fn Project, a cloud-agnostic framework, in public clouds. Similar to the
            local installation that we used in the examples above, it can be installed on any public cloud IaaS. For
            most IaaS clouds it is enough to pass the installation command directly to the creation of a compute
            instance as so-called "user data" (commands that are acted upon when the instance is provisioned). Also,
            when running Fn in a public cloud, don’t forget to enable access rules for Fn Server allowing port 8080,
            either from your own IP or all public IP addresses.</p>

        <p>Obviously, when running Fn Project on an IaaS you do not get the true pay per invocation benefit as you would
            with a FaaS implemented by the cloud provider as PaaS. Still, functions are run serverless from a user’s
            perspective in a standardized, portable, and scalable way.</p>

        <p>Once Fn Server is running on your favourite cloud provider, you could deploy the recommender example from
            above in two different ways.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# example 1 (for demo purpose only, in production use approach below)
# note: run these commands on the cloud instance
$ fn apps create advtravel
$ fn routes create advtravel /fn-recommend DOCKER_ID/fn-recommend:0.0.2

# check for the created route
$ fn routes list advtravel
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Note that with the two commands above you never had to copy over the function or the container image to the
            cloud instance. When the function is invoked the first time, Fn will pull the Docker container, store it
            locally, and then run the function.</p>

        <p>Another probably even more useful way to deploy the function is to set the FN_API_URL environment variable
            locally, point it to the remote cloud instance, and then run the local Fn deploy command against the remote
            cloud instance.</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# example 2
# run these commands on cloud instance


$ export FN_API_URL=URLCloudInstance
$ fn deploy --app advtravel 
$ fn routes list advtravel
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Once the Fn is running in the cloud and your application is deployed you can access the application from a
            local machine using the command-line or Postman. The invocation is the same as in the local example—just
            replace localhost with the public IP address of your cloud instance:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
$ curl -X POST --data @testdata/syd.json PUBLIC_IP:8080/r/advtravel/fn-recommend 
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>A recorded live demo from the Devoxx conference about deploying a Fn-based recommendation engine mock on IaaS
            can be seen at footnote [11].</p>

        <h3>JAX-RS, Spring Cloud and more</h3>

        <p>Since Fn Project has Docker as the only dependency and for Java projects a Maven pom.xml file is also
            generated, your function development can be easily extended to use other Java frameworks.</p>

        <p>Work has been done by the Fn team to support JAX-RS with Fn projects [12]. Spring also supports the
            implementation of business logic as functions using their convention-over-configuration approach with Spring
            Cloud Functions. Spring Cloud Functions can be used together with Fn [13, 14].</p>

        <h3>Fn LB</h3>

        <p>A separate component, Fn LB deals with load balancing and intelligent traffic routing. If functions are
            deployed as hot functions, a container is kept alive for 30 seconds (and not restarted for every
            invocation). Fn LB will then route invocations to these hot functions to ensure optimal performance [15].
        </p>

        <h3>Fn Flow</h3>

        <p>At the beginning of this article we discussed the difference between microservices and FaaS and explained
            that a microservice typically contains more than a single method or function. Today, graphical tools or
            higher-level PaaS are often used to compose FaaS into more meaningful larger services. However, these
            graphical tools often don’t provide much visibility into the details of the higher-level service. Lessons
            learned from development with ESB and BPEL show that these details cannot all be displayed at the same time
            and therefore they are more often than not buried under some property tab of the graphical model. Therefore,
            showing "flow" in a graphical model is often limited.</p>

        <p>Fn Flow tackles this issue for Fn Project. It follows an interesting, different, code-first approach by using
            the Java 8 CompletableFutures API with methods such as thenApply() or then thenCompose(), etc. No graphical
            tool or lengthy YAML file is required; the composition of functions is done with Java 8 constructs only and
            is therefore easily readable.</p>

        <p>An interesting application of this concept is shown in a demonstration of using SAGAs instead of an ACID
            transaction for a travel booking application based on microservices [16].</p>

        <p align="center"><img alt="Using SAGAs for a travel booking application based on microservices"
                src="https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/img/serverless-fn-project-figure4.jpg" style="width: 720px;" /></p>
        <p align="center" class="xsml">Using SAGAs for a travel booking application based on microservices</p>

        <p>What looks like a regular Java 8 program at first sight, during execution resembles more like what you might
            know from Apache Spark. The execution happens in parallel, function input parameters are being marshalled
            and return values are being unmarshalled. Every function is executed in its own container using chaining,
            error handling and fan in/out.</p>

        <p>Fn Flow can track the call graphs and visualize them (the screenshot below is taken from [17]).</p>

        <h3>Fn on Kubernetes</h3>

        <p>At Kubecon in December 2017, support for Fn on Kubernetes was officially announced.</p>

        <p>Fn can now be installed from the command line using Helm, a Kubernetes package manager. Preconfigured
            packages of Fn resources, including Fn service, Fn UI, Flow service and Flow UI, are provided as a Helm
            chart. Using this Helm chart, Fn is deployable on any Kubernetes cluster [18]. It also enables the running
            of Fn on the brand new Oracle managed Kubernetes service, Oracle Container Engine (OCE) or a local
            installation of minikube on your laptop [19] [20].</p>

        <p>If Fn LB is deployed with Kubernetes, it can be updated if Fn Server Kubernetes pods are added or removed.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>Fn Project is an interesting new approach to the serverless world. It is cloud agnostic and therefore avoids
            the cloud vendor lock-in. Further, developers are not bound to certain languages when using Fn. Functions
            are automatically placed into a Docker image without any additional effort from the developer, so they can
            be run anywhere by just pointing Fn to the correct image on Docker Hub.</p>

        <p>Fn ties into the world of Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects with support for Kubernetes and
            Prometheus as a first start and with hopefully more to come. Last but not least, it will be interesting to
            see if Oracle or any other cloud provider will offer an Fn-based FaaS service as PaaS in the near future
            with pay per invocation and fully automated scaling [21].</p>
