        <h2>A quick recap</h2>



        <!--<p>Greetings, and welcome to <strong>Chapter Two</strong> of our journey!</p>-->

        <p>In the previous article we showed the ProximaSafe scope, overall architecture and the components need to
            achieve our goal: get the stream flow coming from a determined edge environment in OCI, perform the
            analysis of the stream to detect possible anomalies and send back the errors to the edge in order to carry
            out corrective actions. All this with development boards commercially available (almost) anywhere and easy
            to pack and transport anywhere.</p>
        <p>Now it is time to having fun fiddling with sensors and OCI Functions, covering a number of areas such as:
        </p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li><strong>Selecting</strong> components our MicroEdge lab environment</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying</strong> functionalities and libraries for Edge components, both emitters and
                receivers (publishers
                and subscribers)</li>
            <li><strong>Configuring and Bridging</strong> our local MQTT server with the Cloud MQTT server residing on
                OCI
                Compute</li>
            <li><strong>Develop</strong> a Serverless component in <a
                    href="//www.oracle.com/cloud-native/functions/">Oracle Functions</a> to return error conditions and
                warnings to the
                edge</li>
            <li><strong>Creating</strong> an API deployment addressing the serverless function, to be accessed from the
                Stream Analytics module described in <a href="/proximasafe/chapter-1/">Chapter One</a></li>
        </ul>


        <p>That said, without further ado let's dive into some practical aspects of the matter.</p>

        <h2>Selecting the edge components</h2>

        <p>During the spring of 2020 (and the relating lockdown) I fell - almost immediately - in love with the <a
                href="https://m5stack.com/" target="_blank">M5Stack</a>
            development boards series, based on the <a
                href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf"
                target="_blank">ESP32 microcontroller</a>. These cute little boxes have an integrated
            display, which - sometimes - is useful to help with building simple and intuitive on-board GUIs (that's not
            my case, I'll always be an ASCII fanboy) or debugging and showing messages contents without bothering to
            open a serial terminal from the Arduino IDE. Furthermore, a sumptuous choice of different programming
            models, IDEs and languages is available:
        </p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> mode and the related <a
                    href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank">IDE</a>: the elected programming language
                is C/C++, it is fun and suitable
                for almost-extinct IT apatosaurus like myself </li>
            <li><a href="https://platformio.org/" target="_blank">PlatformIO</a> IDE, which is powerful and cool at the
                same time: it allows to perform static code analysis
                and neatly manages projects and libraries</li>
            <li>UIFlow, a graphical environment (web-based and/or local app) that's programmable in Blockly and
                <a href="https://micropython.org/" target="_blank">MicroPython</a>
            </li>
        </ul>



        <p>Needless to say, I'll go for the first choice. I cleary remember the time when IDEs didn't exist (yes, I'm
            that
            old) and all you got from a compile-link-run session was a disturbing message that read "segmentation fault
            (core dump)". We now have modern and productive environments, and - overall - choice, so pick up your
            environment of choice and follow the rest of this articles as a reference.</p>

        <p>In addition to the ESP32 family, we'll use an ESP8266-based smart badge that will act as a wearable
            device.</p>
        <p>And, of course, we can't help but use the ubiquitous Raspberry Pi - that year over year is getting specs
            almost on-par with his bigger cousins - to act as physical and logical link between edge and the Cloud
            environments. This pocketable Linux device will be crucial in bridging the local MQTT instance to the OCI
            Cloud instance described and set up in the previous chapter.</p>

        <h3>The Raspberry Side: MQTT Bridging</h3>

        <p>Installing <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a> and the related CLI utilities on a Pi is
            straightforward, by issuing the command sudo apt install mosquitto and sudo apt install mosquitto-clients.
            Once started, you can check the status by issuing the command systemctl status mosquitto, which should be
            followed by
            something like:</p>

        <p>and reaching the Bridges section:</p>


        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

        </div>

        <p>we can add the following parameters:</p>


        <div class="ocode">

            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
connection proxima
address [host:port]
topic # out 0 "" edge/
topic alarm in 0 cloud/ edge/

</code></pre>
        </div>





        <p>Where the host and port parameters are the public IP address and the of the OCI instance we configured
            in the first episode, and the other parameters indicate that:
        </p>
        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>in the first line, we're going to relay all messages to the Cloud instance (prefixed by the edge/
                parameter), so <strong>all</strong> the messages issued on the the edge in the topic device/machine/x
                will be
                processed by the Cloud Mosquitto as edge/device/machine/x.</li>

            <li>in the second line, we'll receive any message from the Cloud in the topic alarm, specifying the
                cloud/ prefix and locally processed in topic cloud/alarm.</li>

        </ul>

        Sure enough, we also need to setup the certificate based SSL/TLS support, so reach for the section
        regarding security and complete it with:


        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Certificate based SSL/TLS support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Either bridge_cafile or bridge_capath must be defined to enable TLS support
# for this bridge.
# bridge_cafile defines the path to a file containing the
# Certificate Authority certificates that have signed the remote broker
# certificate.
# bridge_capath defines a directory that will be searched for files containing
# the CA certificates. For bridge_capath to work correctly, the certificate
# files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run "openssl rehash
# [path to capath]" each time you add/remove a certificate.
# bridge_capath
bridge_cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt

# Path to the PEM encoded client certificate, if required by the remote broker.
bridge_certfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt

# Path to the PEM encoded client private key, if required by the remote broker.
bridge_keyfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.key

# When using certificate based encryption, bridge_insecure disables
# verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. This can be
# useful when testing initial server configurations, but makes it possible for
# a malicious third party to impersonate your server through DNS spoofing, for
# example. Use this option in testing only. If you need to resort to using this
# option in a production environment, your setup is at fault and there is no
# point using encryption.
bridge_insecure true
</code></pre>
        </div>


        <p>thus creating a certs directory under /etc/mosquitto and copying the ca.cert, server.crt and
            server.key files we generated during the first episode in section <strong>Secure the MQTT Server running on
                OCI Compute</strong>. </p>


        <p>That is easy to test. Issuing a listening command to the Cloud instance in a shell, as shown in the first
            episode:
        </p>


        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

</code></pre>
        </div>


        <p>and sending a message to the local Raspberry Pi</p>


        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

            <pre>
<code>
mosquitto_pub -h [your RPi IP address] -t test -m 'Sympathetic resonance'
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>we should receive on the Cloud Mosquitto shell the message:
        </p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

        </div>

        <p>showing that the two thingies are effectively talking themselves - albeit in a single direction, for now.</p>
        <p>The pipelines we'll design in Stream Analytics will provide the logic to test the bidirectional dialogue.
            And,
            now, let's have some healthy fun with sensors!</p>

        <h2>Edge Programming</h2>
        <p>The goal is to build an edge that can easily fit into a small briefcase, and - certainly - an ESP32-based kit
            will help saving space, time, and power consumption. Let's consider a setup that includes some edge
            emitters (MQTT publishers), some receivers (MQTT subscribers) and the Gateway:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>A multipurpose <strong>*ESP32 </strong>development board that can be used to generate single or burst
                messages to
                trigger actions within Stream Analytics. Connecting a detection sensors - of course - would be a lot
                better, but I'd find hard to simulate a gathering alert within my workshop room. Firing the messages
                directly from the board has a clear advantage over messages sent from a shell or a software
                simulator: we could connected a sensor to the board and maintain the same codebase.</li>


            <li>An <strong>Arduino MKR1000</strong> connected to a DHT11 sensor. I tried to use an Env Hat based on the
                BMP80
                sensor attached to a M5Stick-C but that proved to be extremely unreliable in terms of data
                measurement: the temperature and humidity detected are heavily affected by the heat generated
                from the M5Stick-C, so I'll perservere with an old-fashioned configuration encompassing the Arduino
                and a simpler, cheaper DHT11.</li>

        <p>Both the publisher and the subscriber will use the PubSubClient API. Specifically, the Publishers will send

        <p>Programming these gizmos is fun and it's a very effective means of spreading the culture of programming
            among students of all levels (including myself). Plus, there's plenty of examples available on the Web.</p>
        <p>Still, we need to design a way to return alarm messages from Stream Analytics to the edge, using the MQTT
            Bridge feature we set up not too long ago.</p>
        <p>As described in the previous Episode, our approach will be as the following:

            </li>
        </ul>
        Either way, you'll be good to go with the function deployment in OCI.
        We will use a Custom Dockerfile to build our image in Python, such as the following:


        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
FROM fnproject/python:3.6-dev as build-stage
WORKDIR /function
ADD requirements.txt /function/
RUN pip3 install --target /python/ --no-cache --no-cache-dir -r
requirements.txt && rm -fr ~/.cache/pip /tmp* requirements.txt func.yaml
Dockerfile .venv
ADD . /function/
RUN rm -fr /function/.pip_cache
FROM fnproject/python:3.6
WORKDIR /function
COPY --from=build-stage /python /python
COPY --from=build-stage /function /function
COPY certs /function
ENV PYTHONPATH=/function:/python
ENTRYPOINT ["/python/bin/fdk", "/function/func.py", "handler"]
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>specifying Python requirements in <strong>requirements.txt</strong> file as we're going to use the Paho
            Library:</p>

        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
fdk
paho-mqtt
</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>and write some code to complete the round trip, copying the certs folder and files used to access the
            MQTT Server on OCI in the function directory. Please find the Dockerfile and the code at this address
            (NOTE: insert the GitHub link, open in a new window/tab).</p>
        <p><strong>Oracle Functions</strong> (as <strong>Fn Project</strong>) requires the function to be installed in
            an artifact called <strong>Application</strong>, a
            logical grouping of functions, which can be created via the fn CLI (specifying the OCI subnets) or in the
            OCI
            Web console following the path <strong>Home » Developer Services » Functions</strong>:
        </p>

        <p>Once the application is created, we can deploy the function (this time we'll leverage the good-ole CLI) using
        </p>


        <div class="ocode">

            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
fn build
fn deploy --app [app name]
</code></pre>
        </div>





        <p>where you can see some familiar Docker (layer-related) output messages and the result of deployment.

        <h3>Creating the API Gateway and an API deployment</h3>

        <p>The mechanisms to expose and consume APIs in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are accessible in the <strong>Main
                menu » Developer Services » API Management </strong>section of OCI Web Console. We'll create an API
            Gateway
            first, and then an API deployment specifying the Oracle Function we created previously. Creating an API
            Gateway involves specifying:</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>The <strong>Name</strong> (duh!)</li>
            <li>the <strong>Type</strong> (public/private)</li>
            <li>the <strong>Virtual Cloud Network</strong> (the one created by Stream Analytics, or your own)</li>
            <li>the <strong>Subnet</strong> (ditto)</li>


        </ul>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter2-8.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter2-8" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>Hitting the blue <strong>Create</strong> button starts the magic, and creation is quick. Then, we can proceed
            to shape our
            API deployment by clicking the link named "Deployments" in the bottom left Resources section and fire the
            <strong>Create Deployment</strong> procedure, which consists of three stages:
        </p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Providing the name, the prefix, and additional Policies such as Authentication, CORS, Rate Limiting
                (quite important if API is exposed to the cruel external world)</li>

            <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter2-9.jpg"
                    alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter2-9" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

            <li>Provide the Routing logic with the path, method (we'll use POST), the type (Oracle Functions), the
                Application and the Function name we previously deployed
            </li>


            <li>Carefully review your API configuration and submit!</li>

            <p>This configuration will be managed by Stream Analytics as a Target, used at the end of an analysis
                pipeline
                to invoke the function and send an alarm to the edge.</p>

            <p>The combination of Sources (messages from the edge routed to OCI Streaming), Patterns already available
                for phenomena detection and <strong>Targets</strong> (Autonomous DB, Serverless Functions, Kafka
                Endpoints) will be the
                triad (in musical context) to be tinkered designing new use cases and discover valuable information not
                previously available.</p>
