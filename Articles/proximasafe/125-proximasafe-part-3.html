        <h2>What we've done so far</h2>

        <p>Greetings, and welcome to <strong>Chapter Three</strong>, the last of this series. In the previous articles
            we set up all the
            bits and pieces we need to build a portable lab aimed to study and develop stream analysis, such as:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>All the <strong>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</strong> artifacts needed, such as Golden Gate Stream
                Analytics, OCI
                Compute running the MQTT service, Oracle Functions, API management and the wiring to connect
                the services.</li>
            <li><strong>Edge</strong> components mostly made on Raspberry Pi, ESP32 elements and Arduino, easy to
                procure,
                setup and stow away</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Now it's time to design some example use cases that imply:</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Use Cases design and considerations</li>
            <li>Assign a task to each of the edge components</li>
            <li>Design and implementing pipelines within Stream Analytics using patterns included with the platform</li>


        </ul>

    <div class="cc01w1 cwidth">
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>We can think of - at least - three scenarios using the technologies set up during the previous chapters and
            effectively make the most of stream analysis:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Checking if the <strong>environmental parameters</strong> of a given perimeter (a closed space, i.e. an
                university
                classroom or an office) are safe: if over a threshold or if there's an up trend in temperature and/or
                humidity, the system will be required to send an alarm back to the edge to take appropriate actions.
            </li>
            <li>Checking if the <strong>number of events</strong> in a determined point and within a certain number of
                seconds
                indicates an abnormal condition: for instance, a sensor in a one-way corridor that simply count the
                passage of people. Should the parameters go over a threshold within a number of seconds or if <em>an up
                    trend</em> is detected, we could decide to stop the people accessing the corridor by turning on a
                red
                'traffic light' to mitigate the chance of a gathering.</li>
            <li>Check if <strong>sanitizers</strong> in specific locations are malfunctioning (empty gel), or are being
                tampered with
                by checking messages sent by the dispensers: if the stream analysis module receives two alarms within a
                time range (few seconds) the we'll warn the person responsibly of maintenance by sending a
                message to a wearable smart tag and solve the problem.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>These simplistic use cases do not fully take into account all the possibilities offered by selecting a
            Geofence in Golden Gate Stream Analytics, that is a cool and useful function for scanning what is
            happening within a defined set of coordinates, but could serve as basis for more sophisticated (and real!)
            analysis performed on any size of environment. Nevertheless, we'll hardwire each flow to different
            coordinates mocking the presence of sensors in the real world.

        <h3>1 - Arduino with DHT11 sensor (Environment)</h3>

        <p>This configuration is the 'Hello World' equivalent of the Arduino programming. The board is an Arduino
            MKR1000, sporting a 32-bit, low power ARM MCU provided by the Atmel ATSAMW25 SoC. Wi-Fi and
            MQTT features are provided by the WiFi101.h and pubsub.h libraries, respectively. No GUI is provided,
            except for the Serial Monitor available in Arduino IDE, so we're (possibly) going to use the
            Serial.println() extensively.
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-2.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-2" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>As I mentioned in one of the previous chapters, I tried to switch to a more compact sensor (a BMP280 hat
            connected to a M5StickC) in order to avoid a scruffy jumper-based connection between the MKR1000 and
            the DHT11, but the temperature and humidity measured is heavily influenced by the heat generated by the
            M5, which kinda misses the objective. So, we'll remain with the MKR1000 - and, believe me or not, it's
            definitely not a leftover from the Proxima City days, I just love the board! This simple board will send
            information about temperature and humidiy that'll be intercepted by Stream Analytics to verify up/down
            trends and eventually go downstream with possible anomalies.</p>

        <h3>2 - M5Stack Fire (Event Generator)</h3>
        <p>The M5Stack Fire (a.k.a the Red One) is based on the M5 packaging and it's based on the ESP32
            architecture. This box is the primary event generator, which downsizes - a bit - its capabilities (it's got
            even
            an IMU posture sensor, that would be a nice feature to enhance the tampering use case), so it'll fire events
            simulating the people flowing in a corridor and events from sanitizers.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, most of the M5 have a tiny cute display, so we'll be able to expose feedback when
            sending/receiving messages to OCI.</p>

        <p>The UI I've programmed is really basic (in fact, it's character based), with the addition of battery level
            detection (found the API call somewhere, and it's not accurate nor reliable, as I discovered), the number of
            messages sent, and results. The buttons are programmed to send a single message or burst of messages
            to trigger a pattern-based analysis in Stream Analytics.

        <h3>3 - M5Stack Core 2 (Alarm Detector)</h3>
        <p>The M5Stack Core 2 (a.k.a the White One) is an evolution from the previous M5 box, it's got touch sensors
            and another bunch of goodies that we won't use, since the its main task is to display alarms for corridors
            and possibly other locations where we need to show an alert - in a form of a red traffic light.</p>

        <p>This box could be expanded with an external display via the Grove port or a relay as an actuator (actually,
            I've put some code for the external LCD RGB display but I'm not using that).

        <p>The <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/sqfmi/badgy-iot-badge/">Badgy</a> device is equipped with an
            e-ink display and the <strong>ESP8266</strong> chip. While e-ink refresh rates aren't
            ideal for contents changing rapidly, it is certainly good for the Sanitizers use case to report to the
            maintenance employee which dispenser machine has incurred into troubles, in order to fix it quickly even
            when on the move during regular maintenance routines.</p>

            messages from OCI. The M5Stick (a.k.a the Grey One) is even smaller than the previous M5, it's still based
            on the ESP32 architecture and it sports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a IR blaster.</p>

            capacitive touch screen, a beefy battery and a
            wide display - looks like we just found the billboard for our microlab! This device will be in charge to

        <p>Since it's a full-blown eInk minitablet with touch support, I suppose I should implement a nicer UI

        <h3>Pipelines setup</h3>
        <p><strong>Check tampering with Sanitizers</strong><br />
            Here's the first pipeline, using the interactive designer included with Stream Analytics.</p>
        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-9.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-9" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>
    </div>


    <p>Translating the visual pipeline into words, here's what it does:</p>

    <ul class="obullets">
        <li>Accept messages from OCI Streaming as a source, defined in the Catalog</li>
        <li>Query all the messages where the field sensors contains the text Sanitizers. Then, three actions
            take place:
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-left:15px;">Produce a geospatial visualization based on Latitude and Longitude
                    coordinates located in the message.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:15px;">Check if the message from the same sanitizer has been sent previously
                    within a short time span via the pattern 'A' followed by 'B'. If this pattern is detected, we'll
                    invoke the OCI Function previously created in Chapter Two to send the alarm back to edge.</li>
                <li style="margin-left:15px;">Format the message to JSON via a To Json pattern and store the message in
                    an Autonomous
                    DB defined as a target in the Catalog (I think that could be a nice addition).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any alarm should result in a message sent to the OCI Function mqtt_pub which in turn routes the message
        to the Mosquitto-Cloud instance, and eventually sent to the edge via MQTT Bridging, using the
        cloud/alarm topic.
    </p>
    <p>The message will be shown on the Badgy and on the Billboard as well, since these devices are listening on
        this specific topic:</p>

            alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-10" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

    <p>The Beeper can also be triggered with an audio alert. Should you be interested in having the audio file
        played on the alert event, I cannot publish that. It's copyrighted (Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze").

        <p>Stunningly similar to the previous one, here are the inner workings:</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Accept messages from OCI Streaming as a source, defined in the Catalog (as before).</li>
            <li>Query all the messages where the field sensors contains the text Detection Point. Then the
                actions:

                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left:15px;">Produce a geospatial visualization based on Latitude and Longitude
                        coordinates located in the
                        message (as before).</li>

                    <li style="margin-left:15px;">Check if messages from the same detection point have been sent
                        previously within a time span
                        (30 seconds, maybe?) via the pattern Up Trend. If true, we invoke the OCI Function previously
                        created to send the alarm back to edge.</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>


        <p>In this case we should light up a red traffic light where the detection point is located in order to
            discourage
            (or deny) the access to that gate, corridor, or location. Since all of the edge components are miniaturized,
            we'll just display a red alert within our Alarm Detector M5 box:</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-12.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-12" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>The Environment alarm pipeline could be designed with the same steps, analyzing the temperature and
            humidity changes in order to detect an up trend, and clear the alarm when environmental values are within
            an acceptable range. Let's follow the pipeline construction steps in details:
        </p>

        <p>From the Catalog Menu, let's create a new Pipeline selecting our Stream.</p>
        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-13.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-13" style="margin-bottom: 5px;"></p>
        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-14.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-14" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>



        <p>A basic canvas should be displayed with the name of the Stream involved. Then, after a right click on
            the Stream icon, we are presented with a menu to add a Stage: selecting the Query stage, we'll make
            sure to process only the environment data coming from the DHT11 sensor</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-15.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-15" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>This query on the data in motion will select messages coming from our environmental sensor by
            selecting the Filters tab in the upper right menu and inserting some simple query data, such as:</p>
        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-16.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-16" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>It's a simple and intuitive mechanism can be applied anywhere in Golden Gate Stream Analytics, that
            makes the construction of pipeline easy and intuitive! Even without committing the pipeline in
            production mode, you can see immediately the effects in real time: note that on the Live Output pane
            only the DHT11 events are displayed.
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-17.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-17" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>We can proceed with pipeline build by adding an up trend pattern selecting temperature or humidity
            as the <strong>Tracking Value</strong> and insert a call to the OCI Function and will return an alarm to the
            edge if the
            conditions are met</p>
        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter-3-18.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter3-18" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>Every time that we feel that the pipeline is ready (and we can test any part of it while designing it,
            interactively), we can commit the pipeline (note that the target elements are activated only the pipeline is
            in
            the <strong>Published</strong> state).</p>

        <h3>Epilogue</h3>
        <p>Setting up a personal development laboratory with the help of few development boards, sensors and some
            OCI resources has never been easier (and fun!). Every test has been made connecting the edge elements to
            a wireless router 4G-enabled that I acquired some time ago (well, I don't have a full 4G connection where I
            live, it's a frontier signal zone), so the connection to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is just another
            variable
            factor in evaluating the lab performance, which - anyway - is frankly good.</p>
        <p>Once the <strong>OCI function</strong> has been warmed up (by means of test messages sent at irregular
            intervals) the
            round-trip time between the anomaly phenomenon induced in the edge lab and the alarm returned and
            processed in the edge is almost <strong>instantaneous</strong>. To shed a light regarding the things to
            improve on this
            base configuration, let's examine the following considerations: </p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Being a development lab based on development boards, everything can be optimized (my code for
                sure).</li>
            <li>While the local Wi-Fi used by the boards is steady, the 4G (or 3G, most of the times) available
                connection used to reach the OCI resources from this microlab represents a 'real world' connectivity
            </li>
            example (no 5G here in the neighbourhood...).</li>
            <li>The MQTT to OCI Python router could be containerized and made more robust within an orchestrator
                (OKE).</li>
            <li>We could use OCI compute to setup a number of VMs injecting load to the Cloud components via
                siege, vegeta or any burden-related generators to observe the behaviour of the system.
            <li>Any other thing that is fun</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I believe that we could reuse the concept, maybe with different sensors, for a variety of use cases that
            encompass the usage of actual industrial sensors, geofences and other goodies.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your patience, and see you on Zoom.</p>

        <p>Zip and Zest!</p>
