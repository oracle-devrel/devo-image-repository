        <h2>What is Proxima?</h2>



        <p>During the hot summer of 2018 (now it seems like aeons ago), the Oracle Innovation Team in Rome created a
            Smart City model - named Proxima City made of Lego Bricks, Arduinos connected to sensors and a bunch of
            Raspberry Pi to demonstrate the capabilities of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>

        <p>We based the use cases design upon the things we dreamed about every day: dispose the garbage in a proper,
            responsible manner, get the latest and greatest news about what was functioning (and not functioning) in the
            city, book a parking slot in the best location available for our working day route, 'login' to the city
            infrastructure as a student, as a professional or as a casual tourist admiring the stunning architectures
            and monuments of the past (we happen, here in Italy, to stumble upon ancient artifacts we can't immediately
            recognize).</p>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-1.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-1" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>


        <p>The dialog with the smart city was implemented through a number of channels: Chatbots, Mobile apps and
            classical web-oriented retrieval of useful information to make our life (a little bit) easier when living
            and breathing in a hyper dense urban chaos like the Eternal City. Eventually, it was a success: conferences,
            speeches, fairs (even some <a
                href="https://www.ilmessaggero.it/speciali/makerfaire/maker_faire_2018_la_smart_city_futuro_proxima-4032740.html">mentions</a>
            and prizes) and a focus on OCI capabilities.</p>

        <p>Having an open design, the physical model was replicated dozens of times worldwide (including Redwood
            Shores!), and each instance had subtle but substantial differences to the original structure, showing how an
            idea can be expanded and improved by interconnecting worldwide teams and adapt the model to the needs
            of a particular city/country.</p>

        <p><strong>From Smart to Safe</strong><br />
            Then, Covid-19 begun to hit our lives. The Smart City concept morphed into something different: as a
            citizen I'd be less interested in knowing that the subway or my bus ride has a 4.2 minutes delay compared
            to the original schedule, and possibly be mindful in determining if I <strong>can</strong> take advantage of
            different urban
            services in a <strong>safe</strong> fashion, extending the safety protocols to closed environments (offices,
            university rooms,
            workplaces). And, matter of fact, this is the idea we'll be facing here, trying to build a lab as a tool to
            design
            safety-related use cases.</p>
        <p><em>Mutatis Mutandis</em>, we'll modify the original patterns and configurations exposed with Proxima City to
            allow a
            Smart City Lab become a Safe City Lab, hence the name <strong>ProximaSafe</strong>. We'll explore a number
            of
            technologies involved in different areas - with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure at the core - to build a tiny
            lab
            that can be exploited to implement any new idea in something substantial. </p>

        <h2>Data</h2>

        <p>Let's get rid of the generic and overrated 'Data is the new oil' catchphrase for a moment, we just need to
            mention the types of data - and their velocity - that a model can efficiently process in each of the stages
            involved in building a development lab:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>edge data, produced by microcontrollers-sensors and gateways, the atomic units of information
                representing state and values in a single, memorable point in time</li>
            <li>data in motion, or fast data - seen as streams of certified information directed to points of first
                analysis and aggregation, useful to detect anomalies or state change before reaching any destination
                appointed to data-wrangling activities</li>

            <li>data at rest, seen as data residing in a structured or semi-structured repository ready for full-blown
                analytics and phenomena discovery</li>
        </ul>



        <p>In this context, we're going to elaborate and deepen the setup of distinct environments to reach our goal:
            conceive and design practical use cases related to safety procedures and protocols by continuously
            producing information from the edge, continuously analyze the streams of information sourced by the edge
            to detect anomalies and - then - store data in a repository suitable for Business Intelligence and data
            operations.</p>
        <p>The logical representation of the data flow could be depicted (L to R) as the following:</p>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-2.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-2" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>Yes, that looks a lot like the three-staged diagram we used to build Proxima City. What's new then? We'll
            introduce a feedback route at the Stream Analysis level, where the errors or anomalies detection
            capabilities can be leveraged to send return messages to the edge and eventually activate some actuators -
            in a lab, that could result in the activation of a 'red flag' in a corridor, or messages displayed in a
            smart
            badge and a wearable device. What can we do with OCI and what's the relationship with microdevices
            present on the edge (i.e. in our lab)? The overall schema can be seen in this diagram:</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-3.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-3" style=" margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>where, on the left, the edge data from sensors are sent to a local Raspberry Pi running an MQTT server
            such as Mosquitto (our Gateway), who happily converses with its Mosquitto Cloud twin (Proxima Server).
            Then, sensors data are sent to the Streaming section and analyzed. The dark arrows path is the road back
            to the edge where errors are reported to execute local actions (issue warnings, trigger actuators, show
            alarms and other types of signalling to subscriber devices such as smart badges, alarm panels, etc.).</p>

        <p>"Why Mosquitto? Why MQTT?" I hear you say. Well, it's open source, it's easy, it's fun. Maybe not enough
            for industrial-strength implementations, but surely beloved by techies, geeks, tweakers and tinkerers (you
            know who you are), with a pinch of 'designed to be debugged' flavor, so certainly suitable for the
            construction of a testbed oriented to developers.</p>

        <h3>Environments</h3>

        <p>We need environments reflecting the considerations described above: perhaps the simplest way is to build
            three different enviroments, with different scopes and different orientations:
        </p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>The <strong>Edge</strong> enviroment containing sensors and gateway. All the sensors and actuators are
                connected
                to a RPi (MQTT Edge Gateway) bridged to an OCI instance (ProximaSafe server) which includes the cloud
                MQTT counterpart.</li>

            <li>The <strong>Data in Motion</strong> enviroment where the events sent by the Edge are received by the
                cloud MQTT
                running in the SAFEserver OCI Compute instance and relayed in OCI Streaming. An instance of
                Golden Gate Stream Analytics connected to the OCI Streaming topic is analyzing the messages and,
                via published pipeline analysis, filters the messages and performs anomalies detection in the Edge.
                Both alarms and filtered messages are conveyed to the subsequent subsystem.
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>Data at Rest</strong> environment responsible for BI and Reporting activities and - more
                generally - to
                enable medium and long term analytics-related tasks.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>So, we can think about the subsystems layout as the following:</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-4.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-4" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>The Edge side of the lab is going to be (mostly) built with some M5stack components, based on the ESP32
            architecture, programmed in 'Arduino mode' (old fashioned but effective C/C++) instead of microPython.
            Being a vintage old boy baby boomer, it was quite easy to start with the antiques No problemo, there'll be
            other parts built with Python, so bear with me. The Raspberry Pi is in charge to host a Mosquitto server, so
            everything is miniaturized and portable, ready to be seamlessy lift-and-shifted from site A to site B
            (during
            lockdown, a mere two-steps walk spanning the opposite corners of my room).</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-5.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-5" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>We'll explore and detail this configuration later in the next chapters.

        <h2>Scope and Chapters</h2>
        <p>The entire setup will be divided in three chapters (there is a strong possibility that this story will become
            too
            long to be contained in a single article), each one with a specific focus:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li><strong>Chapter 1</strong> (well, you're reading it right now): setting up, connect and test the Oracle
                Cloud
                Infrastructure services needed to listen to events from the Edge, and successfully handle the stream
                of data to detect an anomaly.</li>
            <li><strong>Chapter 2:</strong> bridge the Edge environment to OCI cloud services, so that communication is
                bidirectional.</li>
            <li><strong>Chapter 3:</strong> unleash creativity and tinker with Edge components to build up a number of
                basic use
                cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's definitely time to focus on the OCI services, so let's do it.</p>

        <h3>Building the Stream Analysis subsystem in OCI
        </h3>

        <p>We're going to build the streaming middle-section of our microlab with two elements:</p>


        <p>1. The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Streaming/Concepts/streamingoverview.htm">OCI
                Streaming Service</a> allows the creation of a stream within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, the
            managed service that guarantees and provides a flexible option to handle the messages injected
            from our miniaturized edge.</p>
        <p>2. An OCI Marketplace instance of <a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/osa/19.1/understanding/overview-oracle-streaming-analytics.html#GUID-E1AC004F-697F-4A94-8D96-9438263FE3F2">Golden
                Gate Stream Analytics</a>, which will be our best friend in
            intercepting streamed messages and applying patterns (and some logic) to identify anomalies.</p>

        <p>These two components can be interconnected easily within OCI and (yes) outside OCI boundaries, so we'll
            start setting up the Streaming component.</p>

    </div>
</section>

<section class="cc01 cc01v0 cpad" id="link4s1">
    <div class="cc01w1 cwidth">

        <h3>Provision and configure the OCI Streaming Component</h3>
        <p>On the Main OCI page, scroll the left menu (hamburger menu) until the Solutions and Platform group, click
            on Streaming and you'll be presented with the Streams summary page, where you can start the
            creation/configuration of your Stream by pushing that suspicious blue button:</p>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-7.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-7" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>Configuration is easy: select a name, your OCI compartment, the reference Stream Pool (if you haven't
            created one, OCI will create it for you and allows you to configure it):</p>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-8.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-8" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 5px;"></p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-9.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-9" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>The creation process is a breeze. Let's test it by producing a test message - the button is located in the
            Home » Streaming » Stream Details page and consuming it in the Recent Message pane:</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-10.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-10" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 5px;"></p>

                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-11" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>Now that the stream is actually working, let's jump to the subsequent step - the creation of the Stream
            Analytics component.</p>

    </div>
</section>

<section class="cc01 cc01v0 cpad" id="link4s2">
    <div class="cc01w1 cwidth">

        <h3>Provision and configure the Golden Gate Stream Analytics Component
        </h3>
        <p>Stream Analytics will be the stream processing center of gravity for all messages sent from sensors and/or
            development boards. In fact, we could consider it as the event driven engine of our portable lab. Being
            placed in the Cloud, we can avoid the burden of management and operations and be laser-focused on the
            development of analysis pipelines.</p>
        <p>The Stream Analytics underlying clustered architecture is based on Spark Streaming and its configuration
            and programming relies on a Designer UI that will allow us to produce the continuous query pipelines
            needed to detect if something's wrong on the edge side. This package contains some little gems already
            configured and ready to use:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li><strong>Oracle Stream Analytics</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Oracle GoldenGate for Big Data</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Apache Kafka</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Apache Spark</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Apache Ignite</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Oracle Java</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Oracle MySQL Enterprise Edition</strong></li>

        </ul>


        <p>The <strong>OCI Marketplace</strong> is the go-to site that encompasses guides, tutorials and a short <a
                href="?ytid=GAE18Eir4C0" rel="vbox">video</a> that shows a
            step-by-step guide to deploy an active instance of Golden Gate Stream Analytics within OCI in few minutes!
            Summarizing the steps included in the <a href="?ytid=GAE18Eir4C0" rel="vbox">video</a>, we are going to:</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Get the Application (push on the <strong>Get App</strong> green button)</li>
            <li>Select the OCI destination region (have your OCI credentials and compartment ready!)</li>
            <li>Sign in to OCI specifying your cloud tenant and your credentials</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll be led to a page in which you can specify the version - pick up the STANDARD one and you'll be
            entitled to use it freely for 30 days, and specify the destination OCI <a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm">compartment</a>.
            The Greyed-out button
            Launch Stack will become active, and by clicking it you are officially - and transparently - using the <a
                href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm">OCI
                Resource Manager</a>], the OCI cloud service that wraps <a
                href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and makes your life easier to automate creation /
            deletion of OCI resources.</p>



        <p><strong>Network considerations</strong></p>

        <p>During the configuration you'll be asked to detail the desired network configuration: normally it's a good
            practice to create your own network infrastructure in advance to have a designed granular access to the
            resources. For this purpose, though, we'll keep it simple as we won't provide Resource Manager with the
            information to create a VCN and let it create a Virtual Cloud Network (public) to keep things rolling
            seamlessly. The network created will be used also by the OCI Compute instance taking care of getting
            messages from the Edge and routing them to OCI artifacts.</p>

        <p><strong>Instance details</strong></p>
        <p>We need to choose an Availability Domain, a Compute shape (4, 8, or 16 CPU - 4 would be enough for our
            project), let OCI assign a Public IP to access the Designer and Admin Console from our comfortable couch,
            and insert the SSH public key (we'll need to SSH to the instance to retrieve the administration password).
            Review all parameters in the appropriate summary page and hit Create - this will trigger a job creation
            within Resource Manager which will provision the complete package (about 3/4 minutes).</p>

        <p>Once the instance has been created, let's open a Secure Shell to the instance via the assigned Public IP
            seen in the Compute Instance page:</p>


        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">

        <p>and fetch the <strong>osaadmin</strong> password to enter the console

        <p>which can be used to access our istance. The link https://&lt;Public IP&gt;/osa/login.html should
            greet us with the welcome page, accessible with user osaadmin and the password grabbed as previously
            indicated.

        <p><strong>Source Connection Configuration</strong></p>

        <p>Okey-dokey, let's connect Stream Analytics with the (OCI Streaming) stream we created previously. We just
            go the <strong>Catalog</strong> tab from the Home Page and select from the <em>Create New </em>Item combo
            the <em>Connection item:</em>
        </p>

        <p>and fill this form with the name of the Connection, a fancy description, a tag (I suggest to use tags
            thoroughly, that'll save you some time) selecting the Connection type as Kafka. Then, quickly move to the
            connection details where we need to provide some info - that you can grab from the Stream Pool Details in
            the OCI Streaming console (Home » Streaming » Stream Pools » Stream Pools Details - and on the
            bottom-left pane named Resources select the Kafka Connection Settings link).</p>
        <p>You've got to produce an Authorization Token - easy to do, go here for a hint, as you can see: </p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-14.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-14" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>


        <p>We'll note (and copy) all the parameters needed to fill the <strong>Connection Details</strong> page form,
            selecting our
            Authentication Token as the password for your username and test the connection:</p>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-15.jpg"

        <p>and <em>hey presto!</em>, we've just joined the core components of this stream analysis lab.</p>


        <p>Within Golden Gate <strong>Stream</strong> Analytics, in addition to the Connection we just created, we need
            to set up an
            object (strangely) called Stream. Hitting the now famous Green Button <strong>Create New Item</strong> in
            the Catalog
            tab, we can select the Stream item
        </p>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-16.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-16" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>and proceed, in sequence, to fill the following forms, specifying:</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>the type of Stream (Kafka)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-17.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-17" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>




        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>the connection, the Stream previously configured (PStream) </li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-18.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-18" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>



        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>whether Golden Gate Stream Analytics should be lenient about missing columns name</li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-19.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-19" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>And, finally, the shape of the messages. Note that there's a variety of ways to specify or determine the
            shape, ranging from <strong>Infer Shape</strong> to <strong>Manual configuration</strong>. I'll explain,
            later in this article, the data format
            used for this setup</p>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-20.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-20" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>

        <p>As much as I'd like to explain the simplicity and the intuitiveness in creating an analysis pipeline in
            Golden
            Gate Stream Analytics, it isn't time yet. We still need to setup more components, but the time will come.
            Now, let's setup an OCI compute instance to host the Cloud-side MQTT server and develop a piece of
            software (in Python, at last!) that will wisely route the messages from MQTT to a Stream.</p>

        <p><strong>Create the OCI Compute Instance</strong></p>
        <p>The creation of an OCI Compute Instance is intuitive and straightforward, but in case you're like me (poor
            ability to keep notions in an organic cache) you'll find a crib here.</p>

        <p>What you would do is to select an appropriate shape: minimal I'd say - at this stage, as we don't expect
            critical traffic volumes. Furthermore, we're headed to miniaturization of a personal lab! Here are some
            suggestions:</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Select the Autonomous Linux Developer Image, it'll save you time and keystrokes, as most of the
                needed packages are included.</li>
            <li>Reuse the Network Infrastructure already set up by Golden Gate Stream Analytics (VCN & subnets):
                although it's not ideal, it'll be useful for this simple configuration.</li>
            <li>Create it as a Stack and execute the Stack with Resource Manager. OCI Resource Manager
                (Terraform) is your friend, with a nice bonus for me (i.e. remembering what I've done later).</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Don't forget to take some security aspects into consideration:</p>



        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Configure the Oracle Linux instance firewall accordingly (the MQTT port must be alive, kicking and
                talking to something/somebody else)</li>
            <li>Setup a Security List and the relating security rule to control the exposure of the MQTT port to the
                edge.</li>

        </ul>


        <p><img src="https://oracle-devrel.github.io/devo-image-repository/images/dev-promima-safe-chapter1-21.jpg"
                alt="dev-promima-safe-chapter1-21" style="border: 1px solid #999999; margin-bottom: 25px;"></p>


        <p>Then, let's proceed to prepare the environment for subsequent steps like:</p>




        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Install the OCI Command Line Interface with <code class="ocode">oci setup config</code>. That will be
                handy to access
                OCI resources from the Matrix command line terminal.</li>

            <li>Setup <strong>venv</strong> with <code class="ocode">python3.6 -m py36env</code>. Yes, we'll use some
                Python here.</li>
            <li>Insert source py36env/bin/activate in a test script and wherever you feel appropriate</li>
            <li>Install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux <a
                    href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">(EPEL)</a>: <code
                    class="ocode">sudo yum install -y oracle-epel-release-el7</code></li>

        </ul>

        <p><strong>Install, configure & test the MQTT Broker</strong></p>

        <p>As said, we'll use Mosquitto as the MQTT broker in OCI with <code
                class="ocode">sudo yum install mosquitto</code>, and add
            some configuration, like</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Create a password file (not really effective for the overall security posture, but I'd add credentials
                anyway): <code class="ocode">mosquitto_passwd -c &lt;YourUsername&gt; &lt;YourPassword&gt;</code>.
            <li>Move the file to the right directory: <code class="ocode">sudo mv passwordfile /etc/mosquitto</code>.
            <li>Edit the default Mosquitto configuration found in /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf in order to:
                <p>Identify and change the default port. If the service is likely to be exposed to the wild internet,
                    leaving the default settings to 1883 would be a no-no, maybe, and add username & password
                    previously set in the appropriate sections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Restart Mosquitto: <code class="ocode">sudo systemcl restart mosquitto</code>.</li>
            <li>Test mosquitto with mosquitto clients, such as <strong>mosquitto_sub</strong> and
                <strong>mosquitto_pub</strong>

                <p>in a Matrix Terminal session, subscribe to all topics with mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p
                    <port> -t '#' -u &lt;YourUsername&gt; - &lt;YourPassword&gt;.
                </p>

                <p>in another Matrix Terminal session, publish a message with <code class="ocode">mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 
	    &lt;port>-t 'Test' -u &lt;YourUsername&gt; -P &lt;YourPassword&gt; -m '{"Name":"Jack Torrance"}'</code>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>if all is well, you should see the message on the subscriber's terminal session: in such a case, grab a
                coffee or a nice cup of tea, as we're going secure our MQTT Server first, and then installling the OCI
                SDK and examples for Python.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Secure the MQTT Server running on OCI Compute</strong></p>

        <p>There's a number of guides and tutorials, on the Web, about configuring and using the MQTT TLS security,
            either via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> or just creating your own CA, Server Keys
            and certificates. What I did here is follow
            the shortest path (creating my own stuff), but feel free to follow your creativity and developer flair.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Note: when entering the country, organization and other info donʼt use the same exact information
                for the CA and the Server Certificate as you might encounter problems.</strong></p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Generate a CA key

                <p>1. openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096 and choose a password, in my case password1,<br />
                    2. openssl req -new -x509 -days 2112 -key ca.key -out ca.crt</p>
            </li>

            <li>Generate a server key

                <p>1. openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096 and choose another password, in my case password2</p>
            </li>

            <li>Generate a Certificate Signing Request

                <p>1. openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr</p>
            </li>


            <li>Sign the Certificate Signing Request

                <p>1. openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Verify that every bit is ok
                <p>1. openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key<br />
                    2. openssl req -noout -text -in server.csr<br />
                    3. openssl rsa -noout -text -in ca.key<br />
                    4. openssl rsa -noout -text -in ca.key</p>
            </li>


            <li>Make a version of the server key that doesn't need the password

                <p>1. openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.insecure<br />
                    2. mv server.key server.key.secure<br />
                    3. mv server.key.insecure server.key</p>
            </li>

            <li>Edit the file /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem adding the ca.crt file content (PEM
                public Key)</li>


        </ul>

        <p>Be sure to put (and mantain!) the appropriate files in a certs directory under /etc/mosquitto and have
            this directory saved where you want to perform some tests, like</p>



        <div class="ocode">
            <div class="ocode-bttn" data-error="Error: Could not Copy" data-success="Copied to Clipboard">
                <div><a href="#copy">Copy</a></div>
            </div>

            <pre>
<code>
[opc@proximaserver ~]$ mosquitto_pub -t 'edge/device/machines' -h &lt;IP

</code></pre>
        </div>


        <p>We won't configure bridging (the dialog between Edge Mosquitto and Cloud Mosquitto) for now, that will be
            done in the second part of our prolix boomer babbling.</p>

        <p><strong>Get the OCI SDK for Python and Install Libraries</strong></p>

        <p>Well, it's time to perform some moves on the chessboard:</p>


        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Clone the git repository from <strong>GitHub</strong>: <code
                    class="ocode">git clone https://github.com/oracle/oci-python-sdk.git.</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This repository contains a wealth of source code and examples, and is regularly updated to reflect the
            evolution of OCI APIs. Then,</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Install the Python SDK: <code class="ocode">pip install oci</code></li>
            <li>Install the Paho Library: <code class="ocode">pip install paho-mqtt</code></li>
        </ul>


        <p>and we're ready to write and execute a little python module that will grab sensors messages from the
            Cloud-side Mosquitto and route the messages to OCI streaming, which in turn will be the source connection
            for Golden Gate Stream Analytics. To do that, we'll grab the example named stream_example.py and taylor it
            to our needs. The module is available here (NOTE: insert the GitHub link, open in a new window/tab).</p>

        <p>Here are some snippets.</p>

        <p>Import the <strong>paho</strong> library enabling the subscription to MQTT topics managed by the Cloud-side
            Mosquitto.</p>

        <p><strong>Testing your router with mock sensor's data</strong></p>
        <p>Before being ready to accept data from the edge, let's describe a simplistic data format in JSON which we'll
            use to program the M5 microcontrollers later: we'll use to test the end-to-end flow issuing a command from
            our own Matrix terminal (I still love the green-on-black, VT100-like, steampunk-oriented shell) seeing if
            it's
            been accepted by the stream analysis module. We'll inspire to what the Innovation Team has already made
            in Proxima City, plus the geo-coordinates:</p>

        <p>We have just touched a number of things here, but the best is yet to come! In the next episode we're going
            to explore the following topics:</p>
        <ul class="obullets">
            <li><strong>Selecting</strong> the functionalities to be assigned to the edge components</li>
            <li><strong>Installing, Configuring and Bridging</strong> the local MQTT Server in the Raspberry Pi</li>
            <li><strong>Develop and Deploy</strong> a serverless function to send alarms to the edge available as an API
            </li>
        </ul>
