        <h2>Why Developers Should Learn Python</h2>

        <p>Python is the first language of many new programmers. In a college computer science course, it's usually the
            first one introduced. Why?</p>

        <p>For one, Python is readable. At times, it’s even close to English—with a little knowledge of the language,
            you can look through the code and get an idea of what it is attempting to do.

        <p>This is in contrast to other application languages of its generation, which might be more confusing. Python
            example to print "Hello, world!" to a computer's console.</p>


        <div class="ocode ocode-simple">
            <pre><code>
print("Hello, world!")

	</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Python Forces You to Write Clean Code</h2>

        <p>In contrast to most other development languages, Python code depends on indentation. In short, you need to
            add spaces to lines of code within a given code block in a specific, predictable way. Otherwise, the code
            won't run.</p>

        <p>This can frustrate new Python programmers! For a beginner, Python syntax can indeed be frustrating at times.
            But after some practice with the language, most come to swear by it. Because your code obeys a predictable,
            visual logic, it becomes easier to read—both for other programmers who may encounter your work, and for
            yourself in the future!</p>

        <h2>Python Is Popular, Especially in Data Science and AI</h2>

        <p>A language could be the most readable in the world and still die forgotten. Many fields of computer science
            are like popularity contests: the most popular tools often end up being the best choice for the job.</p>

        <p>Popular languages have a greater selection of libraries, which save a developer incredible amounts of time
            and effort. Popular languages also tend to have more tutorials and documentation, so you'll be more likely
            to find solutions to your problems.</p>

        <p>And if you have any interest in <a
                href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-data-science.html">data science</a> or <a

                href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/">AI</a> and data science industries.
            This practically guarantees its survival.</p>

        <h2>Brief History of Python</h2>

        <p>In 1989, Guido van Rossum was working at a computer science lab in the Netherlands. He decided to write a
            language that would improve on the faults of the most popular ones of his time. Five and a half years later
            he released it, calling it "Python" after "Monty Python's Flying Circus," a British comedy show he was fond
            of.</p>

        <p>It was slow at first, but Python got a big break when a young <a href="?ytid=KKQS8EDG1P4" rel="vbox">Google
                announced it used Python</a> for many internal processes.</p>

        <p>In 2005 Python released Django, a framework for building web applications. Django exploded in popularity and
            came to challenge the then-dominant Ruby on Rails framework.</p>

        <p>By 2011, Python was the most taught language in computer science programs across the country.
            A few years later it became the de facto standard for researchers in the Machine Learning and Artificial
            Intelligence fields, likely due to its ease of use and readability.</p>

        <p>While von Rossum crowned himself Python's "benevolent dictator" for many of its early years, Python's
            development is now handled by the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank">Python Software
                Foundation</a>.</p>

        With its status cemented by the most cutting-edge fields of our time, Python's future looks bright!

        <h2>What Can You Build with Python?</h2>
        <p>As a general-purpose language, the answer is: pretty much anything! Python excels when you have a complex
            task you need to simplify, a short script to run, or a large dataset you need to manipulate.</p>

        <ul class="obullets">
            <li>Simple scripts for automating workflows</li>
            <li>Web scrapers to harvest internet data</li>
            <li>Standalone binaries (i.e., apps) using Py Installer</li>
            <li>High-powered web apps and REST APIs using Flask or Django</li>
            <li>Machine learning programs and artificial intelligence</li>
            <li>"Glue code" that connects software in different languages</li>
            <li>Trading apps that manage money</li>
            <li>Open-source software development</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's only the tip of the iceberg! Python programming language is actively used across all domains of
            contemporary computer science. Since Python development is more efficient than most other languages it is a
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/startup/">popular choice for startups</a>, where changes to the codebase
            must be made quickly and cheaply.</p>

        <p>It's also a hit among scientists and mathematicians, with a number of powerful in-house libraries for
            statistics and complex math.

        <h2>Popular Python Libraries</h2>
        <p>Package libraries are an essential service for any modern programming language. Without them, every coder
            would need to write their own software for the most routine, commonplace tasks.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, Python has a great selection of packages for all your programming needs. You can peruse them at
            <a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank">Python Package Index</a>. Some all-star libraries written in
            Python are listed below: </p>

        <ul class="obullets">

            <li>Beautiful Soup is a super-charged scraper of HTML, allowing a developer to extract data from the web at
                scale</li>
            <li>Flask and Django, mentioned briefly above, provide blazing fast web development for both simple and
                complex use cases</li>
            <li>NumPy and Matplotlib enable data visualizations both simple and stunning</li>
            <li>PyTorch for world-class machine learning</li>

        <h2>What Is Python Web App Development?</h2>
        <p>Python applications for the web are usually built on two main platforms, Flask and Django. Flask is simpler,
            cleaner, and easier for beginners. Django has more features and can scale to a vast number of users.</p>

        <p>If you come from a JavaScript background, Flask is to Django what Express is to Nest.</p>

        <h2> What Is Flask?</h2>
        <p>More specifically, <a href="https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/" target="_blank">Flask</a> is a
            "microweb framework." It's a lot smaller than your average boilerplate-filled tool. It requires no outside
            libraries or components and is built entirely on vanilla Python.<br />
            However, you can easily mix in third-party tools for added effectiveness.</p>

        <p>Flask is designed for rapid application development. It's ideal for prototyping a new idea before fleshing it
            out more completely in a bigger framework like Django.

        <h2>What is Django?</h2>
        <p>How popular is <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>, Python's most popular web
            framework?</p>

        <p>Instagram, the social media giant, scaled to a million users on Django. It's currently used by Pinterest,
            Udemy, Spotify, and Dropbox. That's how popular. Django is an open-source framework "for perfectionists with
            deadlines," according to its docs. It's cross-platform and works equally well on Windows and Mac.</p>

        <p>Django is built on an MVC model, short for Model-Viewer-Controller. MVC is a special pattern in computer
            science, the goal of which is to separate the concerns of a web app into its three separate components.</p>
        <p>When a client sends a request it first hits the controller, which handles the traffic of different incoming
            requests. It passes that traffic onto different models, which handle the data and logic of the request. The
            model then exports that response to the viewer, which renders the presentation of the data to the client.
        </p>
        <p>This makes for a simple, fault-tolerant framework. Django excels with scaling in size and complexity as a
            result.</p>

            the field, but there is an almost endless selection of instructors to choose from.</p>

        <p>Once you learn the basics, try testing your knowledge with some exercises. There are plenty of options here
            as well. Exercism is a great resource for a programmer looking to sharpen their talents. Exercism offers
            targeted challenges with mentors and fun testing using the command line.</p>

        <p>If you want to dive deeper into data science, try out <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python"
                target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. Most online data scientists swear by the platform as the foremost resource.
        </p>

        <p>How about using <a href="https://github.com/python" target="_blank">Python on GitHub</a> Even though there
            are plenty of sources to use and learn Python, for example, online reference books, video tutorials, and
            websites, developers can also count GitHub as a reliable source to learn Python.</p>

        <p>Finally, the best way to learn any programming language, in the long run, is to build something meaningful
            with it. Try creating a web scraper, a simple API, or an automation script!</p>
