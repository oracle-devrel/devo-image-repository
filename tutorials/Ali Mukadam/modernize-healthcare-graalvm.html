        <p>Imagine a Fortune 5 company, empowering millions of people worldwide with the information,
            guidance, and tools to make personal health choices, setting out to work on two parallel
            streams for modernizing their HealthCare platform’s Cloud-Native tech stack.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Stream 1</strong>: Existing Microservices comprise Java 8 + Spring + OpenJDK
                    JIT as JRE, to be containerized in a Hybrid Cloud platform.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stream 2</strong>: New Microservices with Kotlin + SpringBoot + OpenJDK 11 /
                    GraalVM JIT, to be containerized in a Public Cloud platform.
            </li>

            <li>Evaluate memory footprint, execution time improvement, and peak throughput with GraalVM
            </li>
            <li>Benchmark Stream 1 with GraalVM JIT vs HotSpot JIT on performance heuristics</li>

            <li>Stream 2 tech stack is being considered with GraalVM Enterprise as an option depending
                on the outcome of Stream 1 benchmarking results</li>
            <li>Serverless (initial thoughts) has got some excitement for GraalVM’s Native-Image due to

        <p>Interoperable healthcare IT enables clinicians to improve care coordinations and ensure that
            the information available to view in the healthcare services is part of a practitioners’
            workflow.</p>
        <p>In terms of the technology stack, here are some considerations and goals:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Huge employee base, hundreds of APIs, and countless integrations and external systems
            </li>
            <li>Optimize healthcare technology in order to provide a scalable tech infrastructure</li>
            <li>Eliminate Local Resource Constraints for Building Cloud-Native Applications</li>
            <li>Implement patterns and practices defined by DevOps and Cloud Centre of Excellence</li>

        <p>HL7 FHIR is a standard for health care data exchange published by HL7 (HL7 and its members
            provide a framework for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic

        <p>The engineering team identified key Proof-of-Value initiatives to optimize the existing tech
            stack with GraalVM without code changes, iteratively running performance loads with
            identified heuristics, benchmark observations, and comparisons. Initial performance load on
            GraalVM and benchmarking it against conventional JDKs (OpenJDK) for feasibility analysis.
            This included two rounds for performance evaluation.</p>
        <p>As a leading healthcare company (Fortune #5), the peak season is typically at the start of
            the year for all health plans renewables in the US, hence the priority at that time was to
            support business peak load in tech frozen state for 1–2 months. This resumed towards the end
            of Q1 2021.</p>

        <p>Actual load runs on Dev Environment Sandbox.</p>
        <p>Load Configuration Details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Concurrency: 100 users</li>
            <li>Ramp-up: 4 seconds</li>
