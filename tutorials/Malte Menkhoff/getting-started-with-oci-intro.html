            <p>Over the last two decades, Cloud Computing has revolutionized the technological landscape, allowing
                companies to rent infrastructure instead of building rapidly-obsolescing hardware on-site. During this
                time, the architectural approach integrating infrastructure orchestration and application code into
                cloud services has evolved with it.</p>

            <p>Today, cloud users have a choice between technology stacks for virtual hosts, master-slave architectures,
                and container clusters. Each stack wraps application code differently, relies on different methods to
                launch servers, and provides different mechanisms to automate fail-over and scaling processes. For
                Enterprise IT organizations managing a large variety of applications, a single stack is usually
                insufficient to address the broad variety of functional and non-functional requirements.</p>

            <p>Hence, spreading workloads across multiple cloud providers is a common strategy to address this
                constraint. However, deploying private workloads across multiple public infrastructure stacks increases
                operational complexity significantly and comes with certain vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>This makes adopting a second generation infrastructure service (IaaS) like <a
                    href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/?source=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211125P00022:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&amp;SC=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211125P00022:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&amp;pcode=WWMK211125P00022">Oracle
                    Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)</a> an attractive alternative. Purpose-built hardware enables cloud
                providers to separate the orchestration layer from the hosts and allows cloud customers to build private
                data centers on pre-built infrastructure pools. Programming interfaces allow operators to build
                extensible service delivery platforms and service owners to modernize applications in incremental steps.
                The bare-metal approach allows customers to run enterprise applications in a traditional way. Cloud
                orchestrators remain optional, and can be added as managed service, but even then the user remains in
                control over the infrastructure resources.</p>

                        alt="Data Center Regions"></a></p>

            <p>Oracle operates a fast-growing network of data centers to provide access to pre-built cloud
                infrastructure in more than 30 regions. In addition, Oracle builds private infrastructure pools
                on-demand, and offers to extend these pools with edge compute or database nodes. In every data center,
                dedicated compute and storage resources are isolated on a native layer three network. Orchestrators,
                including hypervisor, container, and network functions, remain private by default and also exist in
                shared pools. Combining open-source orchestration technologies with cloud-agnostic monitoring and
                management services allows operators to build a control center for hybrid cloud services.</p>

            <p>End-to-end programmability ensures fast and flexible resource deployments. Platform components like
                middleware, integration, and database infrastructure, provided either as managed or as unmanaged
                services, offer a choice between convenience and control. At the same time, standard hardware controls

            <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a deep and broad platform of public cloud services that enables
                customers to build and run a wide range of applications in a scalable, secure, highly available, and
                high-performance environment.</p>

            <p>For on-premises requirements, OCI is available with the new Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer located both
                behind a company’s private firewall and in their data center.</p>

            <p>Cloud operations engineering is a relatively new field which extends the scope of IT service management
                (ITSM). It represents an important step towards more agility and flexibility in service operation. The
                concept of “Infrastructure as Code” replaces runbook tools and has become an enabler of self-service
                delivery, even for complex solution architectures. Operators empower service owners and developers to
                add, change, or delete infrastructure on demand with deployment templates for logical resources. Service
                consumers gain flexibility to provision virtual infrastructure, while resource operators remain in
                control of the physical infrastructure.</p>

            <p>This series aims to provide a path for IT organizations introducing cloud engineering. We start with a
                short introduction of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), show how to define logical resources for application
                and database services, and end with an example showing how to consolidate infrastructure and application
                services in a self-service catalogue. We’ll build on the official <a
