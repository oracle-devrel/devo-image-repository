                    <p>Terraform. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). Automation. DevOps. DevSecOps. So many buzz words are
                        floating around… what’s the big deal anyway? There are lots of different ways to manage IT
                        resources and cloud infrastructure. What makes Terraform so great? Why should you care about
                        IaC? IaC might not be for everyone, but it is for <em>almost</em> everyone.</p>

                    <h2 id="so-many-ways-to-manage">So Many Ways to Manage</h2>
                    <p>Let’s start with the basics. When there are IT resources to manage, what are some of our common
                        options?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GUI (aka Console)</li>
                        <li>Command-Line Interface (CLI)</li>
                        <li>API</li>
                        <li>IaC tools</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="guis">GUIs</h3>

                    <p>Most of us start with the GUI. In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) this is the <a
                            href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html?source=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211117P00010:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&SC=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211117P00010:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&pcode=WWMK211117P00010">OCI
                            Console</a>. GUIs are typically pretty fancy, fun, and easy to use. While they can be
                        entertaining and great for initially learning a system/platform, they’re not always the most
                        scalable or efficient. UIs require time and manual user intervention (unless you’re using
                        something to automate the pointing-and-clicking, such as <a
                            href="https://www.selenium.dev">Selenium</a>, but that’s a pretty niche edge case). Things
                        only “work” when someone’s there to click a button. It’s difficult (read: <em>impossible</em>)
                        to rapidly manage resources using a UI. Just the time it takes to point-and-click, plus wait for
                        the browser to update… it’s not super fast.</p>

                    <p>Another downside to consider with GUIs is that it’s a bit more difficult to roll back should
                        something go sideways. Rolling back typically involves lots of pointing-and-clicking, undoing
                        the changes that were previously made. More time and human involvement. Yeck. Great for learning
                        and playing around, but certainly not ideal for maintaining anything beyond a lab/sandbox
                        environment.</p>

                    <h3 id="clis">CLIs</h3>

                    <p>CLIs are marginally better than a GUI. Instead of pointing-and-clicking, commands are issued.
                        CLIs are really a text user interface. Most CLIs allow for running “headless”, meaning they do
                        not require user input (all input can be provided at runtime). One benefit here is that it’s
                        easier to use CLIs with automated workflows. It’s a step in the right direction. Unless there’s
                        some sort of scripting (shell scripts, Ruby, Python, etc.) used, it’s impossible to embed any
                        sort of logic when using CLIs. This means that it’s great to send a single command (or even a
                        string of commands), however it can be difficult to maintain a high level of assurance when
                        using CLIs (without more involved scripting logic being used with the CLI).</p>

                    <h3 id="apis">APIs</h3>

                    <p>Who doesn’t love APIs? At the end of the day, almost everything interacts with the underlying
                        APIs. Most GUIs, CLIs, and even IaC tools interact with APIs to do what they do. Whether you use
                        curl, <a href="https://www.postman.com">Postman</a>, <a href="https://paw.cloud">Paw</a>, or
                        other tools, you’re typically interacting with a single API endpoint. There’s still an inherent
                        lack of logic (unless you use some sort of scripting/application to add this).</p>

                    <p>Many of us have written small scripts/apps that interact with APIs to achieve certain outcomes.
                        This is terrific, but it’s pretty manually intensive to create. For many of us, it takes a short
                        bit to custom-build a script/app for each type of management need. While this gives an extreme
                        amount of customizability (the sky’s the limit with what you can do), it’s really not practical
                        or scalable.</p>

                    <p>All cloud providers present an API for managing the platform. OCI is no exception, providing a
                        terrific <a
                            href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/?source=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211117P00010:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&SC=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211117P00010:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&pcode=WWMK211117P00010">API
                            interface</a> for developers and users to utilize when interacting with OCI. It’s certainly
                        one option. There are other tools such as <a href="https://www.upbound.io">Upbound</a> that
                        offer a great twist for having a single interface managing multiple backend interfaces.</p>

                    <h3 id="iac-tools">IaC Tools</h3>

                    <p>These are tools that are designed from the ground-up to manage infrastructure resources using
                        code. Resources are defined in code, with the tool itself providing the necessary structure and
                        logic to quickly and easily build a definition of what you need/want an environment to be. The
                        basic “scaffolding” (logic elements, API interactions, etc.) are all abstracted, allowing you to
                        focus on describing the resources you need/want to exist in the environment.</p>

                    <p>This is by far one of the easiest and fastest ways to build and maintain cloud environments. This
                        isn’t limited to cloud - on-premesis resources can often be managed with IaC tools. Are you
                        using multiple cloud providers? Even more reason to utilize IaC in managing your IT
                        infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>With IaC, we’re often using git on the back-end, allowing us to get a great history of changes
                        (which can also allow for easy and rapid rollbacks). Using git for storing the code definitions,
                        we’re able to use pretty standard processes and tools to monitor/approve/manage changes before
                        they’re made. Whether using policy-as-code (such as <a
                            href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org">Open Policy Agent</a>, with implementations such as
                        <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/oci-pac-opa">Policy-as-Code on OCI using Open Policy
                            Agent</a>) or a manual pull request (PR)/merge request (MR) review process, you can have a
                        really solid review/approval/compliance mechanism (not to mention yet another audit trail that’s
                        separate from the cloud/platform itself).
                    </p>

                    <p>One of the most common and popular IaC tools is <a href="https://www.terraform.io">HashiCorp
                            Terraform</a>, with other tools (such as <a href="https://www.pulumi.com">Pulumi</a>) also
                        being available. The end goal with these tools is to manage infrastructure programmatically.</p>

                    <p>Some like to use tools that are predominantly in the realm of configuration management (such as
                        <a href="https://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io">Chef</a>/<a
                            href="https://cinc.sh">Cinc</a>, etc. These are certainly options for managing
                        infrastructure, but you may be better off with tools that focus on <em>infrastructure
                            management</em> (and less about <em>configuration management</em>). OCI is no exception in
                        supporting many of these different platforms.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the rest of this series, we’re going to target using Terraform to manage OCI infrastructure.
                        Why Terraform? It’s fairly mature at this point, widely adopted and has support for a wide
                        variety of platforms. Many cloud platforms (including OCI) and IT systems support using
                        Terraform to manage resources. There are plenty of examples, platforms and strong user support
                        for it, making it an ideal tool. Terraform is targeted at managing infrastructure, not so much
                        the configuration management side of things. And it’s super powerful when combined with a
                        traditional configuration management tool like Ansible.</p>

                    <p>This series will take you through how to harness the power of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) in
                        your environment. If this is your first time using Terraform, you’re a bit rusty, or you’re just
                        looking to fill any potential gaps in your knowledge, this should be a worthwhile time
                        investment. It’s fairly short, but will take you through the basics of how Terraform works, then
                        into an actual working example. During the journey, you’ll find several key resources which
                        you’ll find invaluable as you continue to work with Terraform to manage your OCI environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Going through this tutorial, you’ll be able to better
                        understand why IaC is so cool and has gained so much traction. You’ll also learn how to harness
                        IaC to improve the efficiency of managing your environment, and that alone is worth the time.
                    </p>
