    <p class="textTA01">If you&#39;re developing database applications on AWS and need a massively parallel, high
        performance, in-memory
        query accelerator for the MySQL Database Service, that&#39;s what MySQL HeatWave on AWS was built to do. Instead
        of crafting complicated ETL pipelines to move data around, HeatWave accelerates MySQL performance by orders of
        magnitude for combined analytics and transactional workloads (OLAP and OLTP). The MySQL Database Service is
        built on MySQL Enterprise Edition, which allows developers to quickly create and deploy secure cloud native
        applications using the world&#39;s most popular open source database. </p>

    <p class="textTA01">HeatWave can perform analytics in real time, and MySQL HeatWave for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is
        a fully managed
        service, developed and supported by the MySQL team in Oracle. </p>

    <p class="textTA01">One of the best things about Oracle MySQL HeatWave is the ability to <a target="_blank"
            class="textLinkTA01" href="https://www.oracle.com/mysql/heatwave/">run analytics</a> directly against your
        existing transactional
        data, so there&#39;s no need to shuffle that data off to a separate system when you need to perform massively
        parallel analysis.</p>

    <p class="textTA01">To get started, let&#39;s set up a MySQL database on AWS so we can connect to HeatWave for
        analysis. </p>

    <p class="textTA01">Note that HeatWave on AWS is integrated with OCI&#39;s Identity and Access Management system.
        When you sign up
        for HeatWave on AWS, you&#39;ll be directed to the OCI login page where you must sign in with an OCI Cloud
        Account. After signing in, you&#39;ll be directed to the OCI Console to complete the MySQL HeatWave on AWS
        sign-up process. When signing into the HeatWave Console, you are directed to OCI for authentication and then
        back to the HeatWave Console. To keep things simple, billing is still managed and monitored in OCI.</p>

    <p class="textTA01">Since it&#39;s a multi-cloud world, in this article we&#39;re looking at creating an AWS
        database we can connect
        to MySQL HeatWave on AWS.</p>

    <div class="exampleTA01">
        <p class="exampleTitleTA01">Prerequisites:</p>
        <ul class="listTypeThree adjustTypeThreePre">
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">An AWS account and root user credentials</li>
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">An Oracle Cloud Account name</li>
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">A compatible browser (Chrome 69+, Safari 12.1+, or Firefox 62+ or any browser that

    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p class="textTA01">We are assuming you&#39;re creating the database and administering it, or at least getting the
        prep work done. Or
        maybe you&#39;ve already set something up in AWS -- either way, this is a quick-and-dirty overview of getting
        started.</p>

    <ol class="listTypeThree">
        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">IAM User Keys</li>
        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Create a VPC</li>
        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Create a database instance</li>
        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Connect to database</li>
        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Activate HeatWave on AWS</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="textTA01">In our example, weâ€™re using a quick and dirty approach to set things up to use HeatWave. </p>

    <p class="textTA01">Basically we&#39;ll lean on the &quot;easy mode&quot; in AWS to create a compute instance,
        network access, and
        database. Once we have the endpoint for our database we can activate MySQL HeatWave on AWS which we can use to
        run analytics. Easy! </p>

    <ol class="listTypeThree">
        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">
            <p class="textTA01"><strong>Identity Access Management on AWS</strong></p>
            <p class="textTA01"> If you&#39;ve set up your own AWS account, you&#39;ve already got admin access. Of
                course, for best
                practices we wouldn&#39;t want to do everything as root, so here we should go to Users and choose Add
                Users. Go ahead and create an Administrator account and check the box next to AWS Management Console
                access. Use a custom password. </p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Choose, Next: Permissions. In Set permissions select Add user to group. You&#39;ll then
                Create group,
                and for the name let&#39;s be descriptive and call it Administrators.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Select filter policies and then AWS managed - job function. In that policy list, check
                AdministratorAccess. Now you can Create group!</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> You may need to refresh the page, but select this new group and choose Next: Tags. You
                can now add tags
                much as in OCI, helping you organize and manage projects. </p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Using Next: Review you can see the groups to be added for this new user -- so
                you&#39;re basically done
                and can click Create User.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> AWS uses access keys much like OCI when signing in with keys. To get the keys for this
                new user, go to
                the IAM console &gt; Users &gt; and choose the name of the new user. Chose the Security credentials tab.
                In the Access keys section, select Create access key.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Just like on OCI, you won&#39;t get another chance to grab the secret key, so select
                Show. You can now
                Download the .csv file and close the dialog box. You&#39;re all set to use the key pair. </p>
        </li>

        <li class="listTypeTwoLI">
            <p class="textTA01"><strong>Create a a VPC and configure for database access</strong></p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Now that we&#39;ve created an admin, let&#39;s create a security group and some network
                access. You can
                read all about creating a new VPC here: <a target="_blank" class="textLinkTA01"

            </p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Much like OCI, this tool allows us to create and configure network access with full
                firewall controls so
                we can open up an endpoint for our database. But we&#39;ll also need to set up some security controls.
            </p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Head to the VPC console at <a target="_blank" class="textLinkTA01"
                    href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc">https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc</a></p>
            <p class="textTA01"> In the upper-right corner you&#39;ll choose the region. MySQL HeatWave on AWS supports
                all availability
                zones within supported AWS regions with the exception of those that do not support the Amazon EC2
                instance types used by MySQL HeatWave on AWS.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> The AWS regions where MySQL HeatWave on AWS is available include: US East (Northern
                Virginia) Region
                (us-east-1).</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Now, in Navigation, choose Security Groups. Choose Create... and add the basic details
                as you see fit.
                Choose the VPC you want to create your database in. </p>
            <p class="textTA01"> For Inbound rules, choose Add rule and for Type, choose Custom TCP. Next is Port range,
                so enter the
                port value to use for your DB instance and for Source, choose a security group name or type the IP
                address range (CIDR value) from where you access the DB instance. Choosing My IP, will allow access to
                the DB instance from the IP address detected in your browser.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> If you need to add more IP addresses or different port ranges, choose Add rule and
                enter the information
                for the rule. In our case, we want to add some ingress rules needed to enable the right ports, 3306 and
                33060. Here&#39;s the details:</p>

            <p class="textTA01"><strong>Create a MySQL database instance</strong></p>
            <p class="textTA01"> In point of fact, you can create a VPC along with an EC2 instance and have connectivity
                along with a
                database <a target="_blank" class="textLinkTA01"

                    a few simple steps</a>. Not only that, it&#39;ll be a MySQL database. The sticking point is that the
                VPC you create won&#39;t be configured to allow incoming outside traffic. Thus, if you go the
                &quot;easy&quot; route, you&#39;ll need to edit the access list on the VPC it creates. That&#39;s not
                difficult, just be aware of the extra steps.</p>

            <p class="textTA01"> Instead, we&#39;ll leap straight into a MySQL database instance. Go to the RDS console,
                and choose the

                obvious).</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Configure the database ID and credentials -- you know how important these will be, as
                we&#39;ll use them
                to wire up our HeatWave cluster to the database.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> In Additional conncectivity configurations, set Public Accessible to yes and the VPC
                security group will
                need to open Database port 3306.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> We&#39;ll set the authentication to password auth, and enter a name for the initial

                is largely set, so we can create our datbase now.</p>
            <p class="textTA01"> Don&#39;t forget that in our security group rules we should set CIDR inbound and
