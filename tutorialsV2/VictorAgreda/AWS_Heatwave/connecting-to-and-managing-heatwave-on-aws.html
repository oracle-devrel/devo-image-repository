    <p class="textTA01">It’s a multi-cloud world today, and that&#39;s why MySQL HeatWave for Amazon Web Service gives
        you a massively
        parallel, high performance, in-memory query accelerator for the MySQL Database Service as a fully managed
        service, developed and supported by the MySQL team in Oracle. This accelerates MySQL performance by orders of
        magnitude for combined analytics and transactional workloads (OLAP and OLTP).</p>

    <p class="textTA01">Oracle designed this so developers can focus on the important things, like managing data,
        creating schemas, and
        providing highly-available applications. Oracle automates tasks such as backup, recovery, and database and
        operating system patching. </p>
    <p class="textTA01">If you’ve never heard of HeatWave, think of it as a database query accelerator with boost
        buttons. One of the
        incredible things about Oracle MySQL HeatWave is the ability to <a target="_blank" class="noteLinkTA01"
            href="https://www.oracle.com/mysql/heatwave/">run analytics</a> directly against your existing transactional
        data, so there&#39;s no need to shuffle that data off to a separate system when you need to perform massively
        parallel analysis. </p>
    <p class="textTA01">Let’s get started! </p>
    <p class="textTA01">MySQL HeatWave on AWS resides in an Oracle-managed tenancy on AWS. You can access it from the
        browser-based
        HeatWave Console or from a MySQL client or application. For this article, we’ll just dip our toe in by signing
        in, provisioning the service, and seeing an overview of what the HeatWave Console offers.</p>

    <div class="exampleTA01">
        <p class="exampleTitleTA01">Prerequisites:</p>
        <p class="textTA01">The MySQL HeatWave Console supports browser platforms supported by Oracle Jet, such as the
            following browsers and
            versions: </p>
        <ul class="listTypeThree adjustTypeThreePre">
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Google Chrome 69 or later</li>
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Safari 12.1 or later</li>
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">Firefox 62 or later</li>
            <li class="listTypeTwoLI">The Console does not support Firefox Private Browsing. </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="textTA01">You’ll also need an AWS account, optionally an OCI account as well. </p>
        <p class="textTA01">Plus, you’ll need a DB System somewhere to connect to the HeatWave instance (this could be a
            HeatWave cluster in
            an OCI tenancy, for example).</p>

        Patches of the

        performed during the Maintenance Window defined on the DB System. A Maintenance Window Start Time is defined for
        you, automatically, and can be viewed on the DB System Details page in the MySQL HeatWave on AWS Console. </p>
    <p class="textTA01">When maintenance is performed, your DB System&#39;s status changes to UPDATING and the DB System
        may be
        unavailable for a short time while the maintenance completes. </p>
    <p class="textTA01">Such maintenance is performed infrequently, and only when absolutely necessary. This is usually

        which the HeatWave
