  <p class="textTA01">If you’re developing database applications on AWS and need real-time analytics and extremely
    fast queries, that’s
    what MySQL HeatWave on AWS was built to do. Instead of crafting complicated ETL pipelines to move data around to a
    separate analytics database, HeatWave leverages in-memory acceleration to provide real-time analytics (OLAP)
    functionality without impacting the performance of transactional workloads (OLTP). MySQL HeatWave is a fully
    managed service, which allows developers to quickly create and deploy secure cloud native applications using the
    world’s most popular open source database. MySQL HeatWave is developed and supported by the MySQL development team
    at Oracle. </p>

  <p class="textTA01">One of the best things about MySQL HeatWave is the ability to <a target="_blank"
      class="textLinkTA01" href="https://www.oracle.com/mysql/heatwave/">run analytics</a> directly against your
    existing transactional
    data, which means you only need to manage one database instead of two, and can get real-time, secure analytics
    without the complexity, latency, and cost of ETL duplication.</p>

    Cloud Account (which you created earlier). To keep things simple, billing is managed and monitored within OCI.</p>

  <h2 id="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Your Oracle Cloud Account name, admin username and password</li>
    <li>A compatible browser (Chrome 69+, Safari 12.1+, or Firefox 62+ or any browser that is Oracle Jet-approved)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>

  <p class="textTA01">To start working with MySQL HeatWave on AWS you need neither AWS experience nor an AWS account.
    However, if you
    do have those, there’s no limit to what you can do to integrate AWS apps with MySQL HeatWave. So let’s get going!
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log into the MySQL HeatWave on AWS console</li>
    <li>Create a MySQL DB System with HeatWave Cluster</li>
    <li>Load some sample data</li>
    <li>Connect to database and run some queries</li>
    <li>Load tables into HeatWave and query some more</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="steps">STEPS</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="textTA01"><strong>Log into MySQL HeatWave on AWS</strong></p>

      <p class="textTA01">If you&#8217;ve just completed the sign-up process and logged in, you may be a step ahead.
        Else you will want
        to navigate to the <a target="_blank" class="textLinkTA01" href="https://cloud.mysql.com">MySQL HeatWave on
          AWS</a> landing page. Here you will
        enter your cloud account name (may already be cached by the browser) and click <em>Continue</em>.</p>

      <p class="textTA01">On the next page you are prompted for the user ID and password you created during the
        sign-up process. Once
        everything is entered correctly you will find yourself on the MySQL HeatWave dashboard.</p>

      <p class="textTA01"><strong>Create a MySQL DB System with HeatWave Cluster</strong></p>

      <p class="textTA01">Now the fun begins! Let&#8217;s get to provisioning.</p>

      <p class="textTA01">Click <em>Create MySQL DB System</em> on the dashboard to bring up the configuration dialog.
        This first
        portion is focused on configuring the underlying MySQL instance itself.</p>

      <p class="textTA01">Fill out the required details:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Display name</li>
        <li>Description</li>
        <li>Administrator credentials (don&#8217;t lose these)</li>
        <li>Select the Hardware configuration. Note the shape determines the number of vCPU cores and amount of RAM.
          <em>(i.e. MySQL.4.32GB is 4 vCPU and 32GB or RAM)</em>
        </li>
        <li>Select the starting Data storage size in GiB&#8230;this can be increased later if/when necessary.</li>
        <li>Select the latest DB version</li>
        <li>Choose a maintenance window (Automatic or Manual)</li>
        <li>Choose an availability zone (AZ). <strong>Note:</strong> If you choose manual, you will be prompted to
          select the physical AWS availability zone. If you have existing applications deployed on AWS, you will need
          to reconcile the logical AZ displayed in the AWS console with the physical AZ selected here.</li>
        <li>Provide networking details. The MySQL instance will become accessible via public endpoint. By default, no
          ingress connectivity is allowed. For the <em>Allowed client addresses</em> you must enter a specific, public
          IP address followed by /32. i.e. if your client computer&#8217;s public IP is 1.2.3.4, enter 1.2.3.4/32. You
          can enter multiple values separated by a semicolon.
          For this example, we will also use the default ports 3306 and 33060.</li>
        <li>Click <em>Next</em></li>
        <li>Provide a <em>Display Name</em> and <em>Description</em> for your cluster.</li>
        <li>Select a shape - this will determine how much memory is available in each cluster node.</li>
        <li>Select a cluster size, from 1&#8211;128. For this exercise, it is recommended you select the
          <em>HeatWave.16GB</em> shape and a cluster size of 1.
        </li>
        <li>Click <em>Create</em>, then sit back and relax for a few minutes while the magic happens.</li>

        flex those command line muscles.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Why don&#8217;t we try picking up a few more rows in our query:

GROUP BY booking.price ORDER BY booking.price LIMIT 10;
</code>
          Make note of execution time.
        </li>
        <li>Exit the MySQL Shell by typing &#8216;\d&#8217; and pressing ENTER.</li>
        <li><strong>Load tables into HeatWave and query some more</strong>
          You&#8217;re doing great&#8230;and now it&#8217;s time to turn up the heat! In this final section you will
          get to unleash the awesome power of MySQL HeatWave.

          <ol>
            <li>Return to the browser tab with the MySQL HeatWave dashborad. Navigate to the <em>Workspaces</em> pane.
            </li>
            <li>Select your DB system, then enter the admin username and password you created earlier (you saved
              those, right?). Click <em>Connect</em> and give it a few seconds to open the door.</li>
            <li>Now that you are connected it&#8217;s time to run the same query as before. This will still run
              against InnoDB, but that&#8217;s intentional.
              <code>mysql
SELECT booking.price, count(*) FROM booking WHERE booking.price &gt; 500
GROUP BY booking.price ORDER BY booking.price LIMIT 10;
</code>
              Note the time it takes to complete&#8230;and get ready!
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="textTA01">Use the left nav menu to select the checkbox next to airportdb. This will select all tables
        in the DB. Click
        <em>Load</em>. This will bring up a window that outlines the task and provides an estimated time to
        completion. After giving it a quick once-over, click <em>Load Tables</em>. Once you load a new table into
        HeatWave, it will automatically track and load all differential data going forward. Or, at least until you
        UNLOAD that table.
      </p>

      <p class="textTA01">SIDE NOTE: If you don&#8217;t need the power of HeatWave for a while you can always stop it
        to help keep
        costs low. While it is stopped, the system will continue to track data DIFFS for all loaded tables. When
        HeatWave gets fired back up, it will automatically update the loaded tables.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="textTA01">Run the previous query again and note the performance difference. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="textTA01">Feel free to experiment with larger data sets and/or more complex queries. Any time you want
        to test
        peformance benchmarks between InnoDB and HeatWave, you need only unload, then re-load the tables.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="textTA01">That brings us to the end. You can either terminate, stop, or leave running the resources
        you
        created&#8230;and don&#8217;t forget to pat yourself on the back. Great job!</p>
    </li>

  <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

  <p class="textTA01">Thus far we&#8217;ve created a MySQL database instance and HeatWave cluster on AWS, loaded some
    data, and poked
    around the system a bit. You saw the dramatic performance improvement gained by running queries in
    HeatWave&#8230;all without the need to ETL any data between systems. With all this power at your fingertips, we
    highly encourage you continue to explore the performance and capabilities. We&#8217;ve only just scratched the
    surface!</p>
